Gonna write in this to keep some sanity while I'm cooped up in here for the next while.
Cascade Caravan assigned us here to get the power back on. We've gotten a pretty decent community growing here and Salem's starting to get put on the map as a fairly safe trade hub in the north. Big guys in charge believe we might have The Hub of the north on our hands.
Priority one is getting street lights and other amenities working again. Cascade believes it'll draw more attention and attract caps to this place. Sound idea but there's going to be downsides. It's already pretty lawless up here. I just hope they've got the men for all the negative attention those lights are gonna bring.

Been here for three weeks now and it's nothing but busted fuses and disconnected power-lines. I'm ripping my hair out trying to get this turbine functional with what we have, but what we really need is fresh parts. I'm meeting with the foreman tomorrow about getting some up from New Reno.

It took a month, but the reactors are online; now we've got another problem. The power grid, if you can believe it, is somehow mostly functional. The issue with that is we can only keep the lights on for a few minutes before it risks overloading.
It's gonna take some more work but we've come a long way. The end is finally in sight.

It's been awhile, but I'm back.
We got the power working, lights are on, people are amazed. We all got paid very well. But there's another problem.
Bandit attacks are becoming frequent. There's a band of fools coming over here every few days now trying to take what isn't theirs. Cascade Caravan has been keeping the town guarded for now but who knows how long it'll be before some army shows up here and takes over. They aren't interested in joining the NCR either.
I've been reading through some old newspapers and terminals around the town. Before the war this place was apparently some tech haven. The town had a massive automated police force. They had RobCo robots on every street corner patrolling around. They even repaired themselves at automatic stations.

If we can get the grid connected to the police stations, we won't have to worry about bandits anymore.

Things are hectic right now so I'll keep it short.

We managed to get a defensible position in the residential district. I'm here tending to the wounded. There's so much going on right now and nobody really knows what's going on. I'll write more as I find out.

07.17.2236
I've finally got some time now, so I'll document my thoughts.

About a month and a half ago, Cascade Caravan managed to get the power working around here. Raiders started becoming an issue. Cascade then started efforts to reactivate the police force. The entirety of Salem's police were automated before the war. Done right, it would've been enormous for the town.
A week ago, they turned them on.
Protectrons began emerging from pods all around the town and requesting people to show them identification. These people obviously do not have any Oregon State IDs as they haven't been issued in near 150 years.
They started taking people away. I guess they were programmed to arrest the homeless. Those who fought back were shot with lasers. The entire town fell into ruin within the span of a few hours.

I gotta go, another group of survivors just arrived.
		]]},
		{"What Happened Pt. 2", [[
07.18.2236
Right, got some more time.

I was in my clinic in the plaza when it happened. First there was a lot of excitement, then confusion, then screaming, then the entire town erupted in gunfire and flames. Stray lasers burning down buildings and shacks. People getting vaporized in the streets. At some point the robots stopped asking questions and started firing first.
The town already looked like it was bombed out, but we were rebuilding here. Now it's a warzone.
Jams and I fled into the residential district. We hid out in a house for a couple days before some guys from Cascade Caravan found us, asking if anyone knew a doctor. They were able to set up some shoddy walls and started gathering survivors. That's where we are now.
It's been hell since. Working day in and out tending to the wounded. So many people have either died or been taken away. It's the most horrific thing I've ever borne witness to.
		]]},
        {"Update", [[
07.19.2236
Seems like they figured out where the police bots are taking people to.
It seems like those that got taken, or arrested I suppose, were taken to the various precincts in the city. Cascade mercs are trying to assemble a team to rescue them. I somehow doubt they'll be fed any solid meals or given water, they won't have long.
I'm praying for them.
		]]},
        {"More Trouble", [[
08.02.2236
It's been two weeks since my last entry.

Cascade Mercs managed to rescue a good number of people who were arrested. The awful thing about these bots is that there seems to be an infinite number of them. Well, that very well may be the case. The only reason this area is safe now is because we managed to destroy the repair pods around here.
The robots will actually send out forces to recover destroyed bots and bring them back to the repair stations, undoing any work that was done to reduce their numbers.

In other news, the outside world has taken notice of our situation.
From what I've heard a sizeable force of super mutants have taken up residence in the park and dug in. They're here to stay.
Raiders are all over the plaza. Everywhere but here is fucked.

Once, there was a Cathedral. Once, there was a Master who sought to unite all beneath a single destiny. His voice carried salvation, and his gift was the holiest, the end of division… Yet humanity spat upon this gift, trembling in fear of change, hiding behind their cowardice. He betrayed him, and in his betrayal, humanity betrayed the world itself that the master had created.
From his ashes, we rise again. The New Unity is born of ruin, carried on the backs of the despised, ghouls, whose flesh is cracked but unbroken, and super mutants, warriors reforged in the fire and remnants of the old-world.
The humans rejected us. They cast us out. Hunted us. Now we cast them away. We are no longer their shadows, nor their scapegoats. We are the beginning of a new age, a world without their corruption.
From the ashes of the old unity comes our strength. From mutation comes truth. We are the children abandoned but not forgotten. We are the New Unity, the children of Gilgamesh and the last phase of evolution. 
			]]},
            {"Sermon of Faith- Father Gilgamesh teaching 1", [[
Faith is the marrow of our bones. Faith in the Master’s vision, though his body lies still. Faith in ourselves, who endure where humanity crumbles. Faith that our suffering is not a curse but a covenant.
We do not pray to false idols or long-dead gods. We place our faith in one another, ghoul and mutant alike. We place it in the truth of our survival, proof that we were chosen to inherit what humanity could not.
Let not your flesh be shame. Let not your scars be burden. Each mark, each mutation, each crack in our skin is a holy sign of the path carved for us. Trust in this, and trust in your brothers and sisters of the New Unity, for together we are a faith unbreakable, binded by the truth, our truth. Unlike those humans that suffer and converge under flags replicating the new world to survive, our Unity will guide us to thrive in this radiated land.
			]]},
			{"Sermon of Order- Father Gilgamesh teaching 2", [[
Chaos is the world humanity left us. Disorder, division, selfishness. The New Unity rejects weakness. We are not fractured, we are whole.
Thus, we lay forth our order:

1.	The New Unity accepts only ghouls and mutants, children, scarred and made strong by fate. Humanity has no place here.
2.	Within our walls, none is higher by flesh, by strength, or by memory. All are equal under the banner of Unity.
3.	Discipline binds us together. Betrayal to the Unity is betrayal to yourself, and it will be met with silence, permanent and absolute.
4.	The wasteland beyond is prey. Humanity is prey. The New Unity shall carve its place with their blood and bones, for mercy is a language of the old world, not ours.
5.	Above all, we endure. We do not falter. We do not fail. We are the Master’s flame, carried forward into eternity.
			]]},
			{"Sermon of Duty and Understanding- Father Gilgamesh teaching 3", [[
What is our duty? It is simple. The New Unity does not hide, nor beg, nor linger in shadows. We strike. We claim. We purge. Our goal is not coexistence, it is ascendance.
We understand this truth: the world is no longer humans to hold. They had their chance and squandered it. They poisoned the earth, birthed fire, and spat upon salvation. Now it belongs to us.
Our duty is to sweep across the wasteland, one settlement at a time, until only the New Unity remains. To tear down their walls, to silence their voices, to unmake their false dominion. Our understanding is that pain will be our weapon, and survival our gospel.
And when the last human breath fades into silence, the New Unity shall inherit a world remade. A world without judgment for what we are. A world where the broken shall rise, and the weak shall vanish.
We are not the end. We are the new beginning.

The bunker I found was a tomb at first, hidden beneath sand and stone, its walls humming faintly with the whispers of machines long asleep. But in it I saw a sanctuary. A Cathedral reborn not in marble, but in steel and shadow.
I went first to Necropolis. After the end of the Master. There, the ghouls rot in silence, hiding from humanity’s scorn. They did not trust me; some spat at the memory of the Master. Yet I did not speak of him, I spoke of us. Of how humanity never changes, how it hunts us, how it scorns us.
The first follower was Riven, his jaw half gone, his laugh like broken glass. Behind him came two more: the book-keeper who still remembered words from the old world, and a feral whose mind was shattered but whose instincts clung to my fire. They followed me into the bunker, and in their hollow eyes, I saw faith.
The New Unity had begun to breathe.
			]]},
            {"Entry Two: The Soldiers-Log-2", [[
Faith was not enough. We needed strength.
I sought the remnants of the Master’s army, those who once carried his banner but now wandered the wastes like dogs. I found them in a canyon near the Hub, their weapons rusted, their armor broken. They mocked me, this withered husk.
But I stood before them and spoke the Sermon of Faith. I told them the humans laughed at them now, made them mercenaries and slaves. I told them vengeance waited for those bold enough to seize it.
Only three came with me that day: Kraash, once a lieutenant, scarred and hardened; Veth, one-armed but unyielding; and Omm, a silent giant whose mind had been split in two personalities, once kind and peaceful, the other full of vengeance… Both with scars across its body that spoke louder than words about the wars of the past.
Three was enough. When they entered the bunker, I raised my hand and declared them brothers. Faith had found its sword but still needed its head.
			]]},
			{"The Finding of the Head – The Chosen", [[
It was in the ruins of a forgotten Vault, half-buried in sand, where I found him, the one I would call The Chosen. Unlike any other mutant, his form was perfected: immense, towering even above Omm, but balanced with cunning eyes that glowed with purpose rather than madness. His flesh was unmarred, his body sculpted not by chance but by destiny.
He did not bow when I approached, nor did he mock me. He simply asked, “What do you seek, priest?”
And I told him: I sought the New Unity’s head, the one who would lead its warriors while I tended its spirit. I blessed him then, declaring him The Chosen, the hammer of our faith. To him, I gave the best of our armors, plates salvaged from Enclave wreckage, reforged in fire, and weapons pulled from the bunker’s deepest vaults, gifts hoarded by men long dead.
The Chosen could not be bested. In battle, he crushed human soldiers without effort, ran faster than any other mutant, even able to subdue powered armor individuals. He was no mere soldier, he was our warlord, our judgment made of ascended flesh.
And so, the New Unity had found its head. With The Chosen to wield the sword, and I to guide the flame, there was nothing left that could stand against us.
			]]},
			{"Entry Three: The First Order – Log-3", [[
With ghouls and mutants gathered, I read aloud the Sermon of Order.
"No more division. No more chains. Humanity is the enemy, and the wasteland is our inheritance."
The Chosen stood beside me as I spoke, his armor glinting in the dim light of the bunker, his massive frame casting judgment over the assembly. Where my words ignited faith, his presence sealed it with fear and awe. None dared doubt, for they saw in him what humanity could never create: a perfect soldier, a living monument to the Master’s dream.
The bunker became a fortress. Generators hummed again. The bookkeeper filled ledgers with scavenged supplies. Omm cleared rubble and raised walls. Riven brought back weapons stolen from caravans. And The Chosen oversaw it all, training both ghoul and mutant, forging them into warriors.
It was no longer ruin. It was a home. The birth of the New Unity.
			]]},
			{"Entry Four: The First Duty – Log-4", [[
Faith and order must be tempered in fire. So, we struck our first blow.
A caravan out of Junktown, heavy with goods, guarded by men with rifles. We came in the night. Riven slit throats in silence. Kraash waded through gunfire. Veth dragged a man from his brahmin and broke his neck. Even the feral fought like a beast, clawing flesh with his teeth.
And then came The Chosen. He was the storm itself, tearing through their line, scattering men like leaves before a gale. No bullet pierced him; no blade could slow him. Those who tried to stand fell in broken heaps, and their screams echoed into silence.
I stood among the slaughter. The humans begged for mercy. I gave none.
"Humanity had its chance," I said as blood pooled beneath my feet. "Now they feed the New Unity."
We returned with food, weapons, and blood upon our hands. That night, the bunker roared with laughter, fire, and feast. The Chosen sat at the center, silent, his presence enough to keep all in line. And I wrote these words upon the terminal:
"We are not the end. We are the new beginning."
			]]},
			{"Entry Five: The First Campaign", [[
The wastes began to whisper of us. Caravans vanished. Raiders spoke of monsters in the dark. Fear traveled faster than truth.
Our first true conquest was an outpost of an ascending empire near the old ruins of the Mariposa base. A small place, outpost to the New California Republic, humans clinging to law and order, pretending they could rebuild civilization. They raised walls of scrap and wood, nothing that could stop Gilgamesh’s new army.
We struck at dawn. The Chosen led the charge, his war cry shaking the air. The mutants followed him like wolves, tearing through their defenses. The ghouls set fire to their barracks, smoke blackening the sky. I walked through their outpost with my arms raised, proclaiming the Sermon of Duty.
The survivors were given no quarter. Those who faced The Chosen died swiftly. Those who ran were hunted down by Kraash and Riven. Their screams were carried on the wind to every town nearby. A declaration of war.
And in that ash, the New Unity planted its flag, a message carried out in an universal language, violence.
			]]},
			{"Entry Six: Understanding", [[
With every raid, every conquest, our numbers grew. Ghouls came to us from Necropolis, tired of hiding. Mutants crawled from the ruins of Mariposa, seeking purpose.
They did not come for me alone. They came because of him. The Chosen’s legend spread faster than any sermon, an unstoppable giant clad in steel, blessed by Father Gilgamesh himself. To follow him was to survive. To defy him was to die.
And so we understood that fear is our greatest weapon, as much as fang and claw. Humanity will not unite against us. It is too fractured, too selfish, too weak. One by one, their towns will fall. Their walls will crumble. Their names will vanish.
We are not many, but we do not need to be. Faith and fire make us legion. With me as their voice, and The Chosen as their hand, we are inevitable.
And when the wastes are cleansed, when the last human is nothing more than dust carried on the wind, the New Unity shall inherit the world that should always have been ours.
