I'm writing this because the direct line to corporate finally stopped picking up.
				
WE. CANNOT. WORK. WITHOUT. POWER.
				
I don't know who the waterbrain engineer that OK'd this plant design was, but we can't so much as run a single press for more than five minutes without knocking out power to the entire area, LET ALONE both presses and the Auto-loader.
				
In the time it took for the phone lines to come back up, we already had a small crowd of townies at the front gate, yelling at our staff. Followed up by a VERY irate call from the Colonel presiding over the military base across the river. Do you know how many boots are stationed at his base at any given time? Because I do now, as well as EXACTLY where he promised he'd plant'em if this happens again.
				
Unless you plan on paying us to staff the country's largest paperweight, you'll get someone out here to see about hooking us up with an on-site generator. A GOOD ONE. Me and my men aren't gonna end up on some Army firing line over a paycheck.
			]]},
			{"Noise complaints", [[
Now that the machines are finally running, we've got another problem. The noise. I don't know if its the shape of the canyon we're in, but God Damn if these things aren't loud.
				
So loud, in fact, there isn't a single place in town where you can't hear the things. The foreman of the local mine took time out of MY busy schedule to tell me about how they can feel the 'vibrations' from all the way underground, 'rattling' their support frames and threatening to 'collapse' the entire outfit.
				
I'd almost feel sorry for the people in this town if it weren't for the fact they keep starting fights with my men off the clock. After a week of filling our mailbox with written complaints, thinly-veiled threats, and open threats; some have taken up throwing bottles and rocks while our backs are turned.
				
I don't care how big the contract corporate snagged is, we can't run these things 24/7. These people have to sleep, YOUR EMPLOYEES INCLUDED! And we can't get so much as a wink in without risking some townie putting a pillow over our face.
			]]},
			{"Vandalism/Sabotage", [[
This is getting ridiculous.
				
Not content with harassing my employees from a distance, someone broke into the factory grounds last night. Tires, brake lines, and seats of every delivery truck. Slashed. Liquid tanks at the rear of the building, nozzles broke and drained completely. Most exterior door locks plugged with chewing gum.
				
Worst of all, they hit the outside Power Distributors. HARD. I don't think they could have done more damage if they used an explosive. Taking into account those rock breakers to the west, or the Jarheads to the east, it could have been just that. Without the supplies on hand to repair them, machine productivity has been cut in half.
				
The sheriffs took over an hour to get here and barely looked over the place before saying there was nothing they could do. One of the bastards actually let off a line to the effect of 'call us if it happens again, so long as the power isn't out'. Enough is enough. I don't care how many times you've denied my request for additional security measures, insurance rates be damned. It's not like I'm asking for a fleet of Protectrons here! Corporate approval or no, I'm diverting a couple of heads to provide on-site security after dark, myself included. I know we've got a ladder around here for cleaning out the gutters, and the roof would make the perfect vantage point.
				
We'll see how clever those townies feel when the next one leaves here in a black bag.

Her name's Vic, allegedly. Doesn't stay in one place for too long, and sells meds at a scalper's price. Travels alone, too. Either lucky, or dangerous. She was asking me about some antenna across the valley the other day. I wasn't too informative.
There was a doctor in the mining town across the basin from here. He isn't there anymore. Pretty sure she had something to do about that.

It was the hair.

They're wigmakers, it turns out. Because ghouls- and some humans- can't grow hair, they fulfil that need and make a decent living off it.

Those freaks from earlier this week came back.
				
This time they begged me to let them stay, and on top of that- they want to set up shop here. I almost started shooting before the fella told me something that actually changed my mind.
				
They sell a luxury item, to luxurious people. By setting up shop in my bar, they'd give me a lot of traffic, and traffic that's willing to shell out a pretty penny too.
The idea sounded right at the time, so I didn't shoot them. I told them they could stay provided they got some better clothes, tried to help the smell, and promised to pay me a share of their profits.
				
They came back the next day with some shitty, dirty suits and some slightly better smelling product. Still smells like vomit, but whatever. We'll have to see how much money they make me.

Hello to who ever might be readin these entries, not really used to keepin a log of things but I figured if we're gonna be stickin around here I may as well.
I can't seem to figure out why no one lives out here, the place is a green paradice in this hell. Space, not many rads, food, wood for building. Its perfect.
				
I was out here about 2 weeks ago explorin the old monestary after the town nearby turned out a bust, ghouls everywhere. And go figure, the monestarys the same way.
A couple of fuckin reavers chased my skinny ass out the monestary and I had to duck in a trailer someone had backed down into the gorge. Probably the same trailer your readin this in seein as I took a liking to it.
After I got done pissin my pants I got out and took a look around, and it hit me. This was the spot, we would just have to build our own buildings but fuck it there's wood and scrap everywhere.
The cliff the monestary is on mixed with the ledge of the old river bed and the mountains makes a perfect barrier. We would easily set up some walls for defence. 

So here we are. I went back out the mountain range and told the crew I found a safe place for us to set up, And I hope I'm right because we're bettin it all here.
I dragged out the remains of the old bastard that backed the trailer in here before the others got here, he'd been here for a long while and looks like he got ate, poor guy.
For now we set up some tents and a few guys will stay with me in 'My' new trailer, and I mean mine. We're gonna be packed in like those little fish that come in cans and it ain't stayin that way.
Anyway I set up this old terminal after Tammy said I should keep track of our progress here for 'posperity' or somethin. So from now on when ever we make any progress or somthin happen I'll put it in here.
I figured she would want the date we started in here so I asked around, the ol bag of shit Mikey said its 'Fall of 2235', don't know how the hell he knows this shit but there you go.

Turns out the place runs on some kind of fuel, need to find something to start it up, some dead guy down there with a bunch of bite marks had some weird green stuff on him, we shoved it in and it started up, and oh god did we fuck up.

Chilled around for a minute, then we could hear the chittering, they started coming out of every tunnel, attacking the generators, so we went up the elevator, guy in a fucking suit locked a door on us, then we shot at the ants from above, let the power run out, and waited for them to leave.

Command needs supplies and workers for this project they're working on, apparently. These guys give us some labor in exchange for guns and meds. I was guarding our diplomat as he negotiated terms. Apparently this is going to be a regular thing.

The people out here are so dirty. Vulgar. We aren't allowed to get close without suits on. May have rare diseases, mutations, etc. We've gotten shot at by random muties on enviros and scoutings. They got L41 last mission.

General,
	
We want to congratulate you on the successful launch of the evacuation program at the North Yolla Bolly Missile Base. Things have been running smoothly on your end and we couldn't be happier about that.
			
Your site has been the best, in fact- you have had consistent and successful evaluations for VIP candidates without any security breaches whatsoever, unlike other sites.

We're writing to inform you that the next phase of the plan is ready. A week from now we'll be having The President arrive at your site and be transferred here. He'll be staying for two days then heading off on the Vertibird with his family.

Keep up the good work.
Best,
██████████████

Hi, there must be some mistake going on here. I'm a pre-approved individual and I'm being kept here because I forgot my card?

Why do I have to wait around here? I just forgot my card, that's all. I'm very important, so you should just let me get on the helicopter already.

Respectfully,
U.S. Senator for Oregon Jeff McNeil

Personal log. 10.18.2077. 1600 Hours.

Evacuation Program here at the Yolla Bolly Base has been a success thusfar. I sleep soundly at night knowing in my charge the President and many members of Congress have safely and discreetly made it to the secure site.
I can hardly say it was all me though. The staff I've assembled here has done most of the hard work. I was lucky enough to have them under me.
Starting in November they want me to take over control of the Evacuation Program in Ashland up north. They've been having some issues running things over there.
I'll have to organize a party before my departure for all the men stationed here. They deserve it.

-Peter Mayhew.
