Colonel just stopped by today, said he was "Running low on "Supplies" again." What a load of bullshit. That SOB has the nerve to come back here again after we gave him 10 assault rifles last month. God, if I see him again one more time there will be hell to pay.

Somethings wrong, the brass just called up nearly all of our stocks and supplied us with what looks like fucking oil cans? im not sure what the hell is going on but something aint right I tell ya.
