I'm here to research Lure Weed on Cascade's payroll. I need samples, and I need you to prove you can even live your ass out there. Just, go find some Lure Weed, a good clump of it. Please and thank you."

lang["#MISSION_MELVIN_WEEDSCIENCE_COMPLETE"] = "Oh shit you actually lived, AND you got the Lure Weed? Well color me impressed. Take this for pay, and let's keep working together. I got a lot to figure out, and a lot of caps to figure it out with if you get me."

lang["#MISSION_MELVIN_ADIET_DESC"] = "I'm currently trying to figure out what place Lure Weed has in the local ecosystem. Maybe some of the local fauna eat the shit, I dunno.

Oh, don't give me that look $playername, I know you've done worse. Probably."

lang["#MISSION_MELVIN_SHITTY_DESC"] = "So, one question we wanna know is how the hell does this stuff grow? What conditions does it need? That kinda stuff. According to some guys I talked to, there's this outhouse. It's on some island in the swamp, I really don't know where. But apparently, a bunch of Lure Weed grows around there. Go to the outhouse, see if it's being used, and report back to me. Gotta know if human shit makes this stuff grow."

You're pulling my leg, this has to be like, a Yao Guai turd or something. No? You're actually serious? Okay, I'll trust you on this. I'll analyze it anyway and see what I can get. Here's the pay as usual."

Figured I'd be okay for one quick trip since you've been killing shit all over. On my way there I saw some Lure Weed, went to snip it up, and SOME BIG FUCKING LAND FISH CAME UP AND ALMOST ATE MY ASS! Shot that fucker in the legs and ran back here to safety. So I guess those things are why they call it Lure Weed. Had the stuff growing out of its head. I wanna know why. Go bag and tag some of those stupid things for me, I gotta see what their biological relationship with that damn plant is."
lang["#MISSION_MELVIN_CALLWEED_HINT"] = "Anglers usually hide in patches of Lure Weed around the coasts of the islands on Dead Estuary. Dig them out and kill them."
lang["#MISSION_MELVIN_CALLWEED_COMPLETE"] = "You got them? Good, good. This hopefully gives me insight into how Lure Weed interacts with this ecosystem, it has to be something more than just growing here. Now I gotta figure out what came first, the Weed or the...Angler, that's what they call it? Yeah, Weed or the Angler. Anyway, here's the usual."

lang["#MISSION_MELVIN_LITTER_DESC"] = "You've seen the raiders around here, right? The Smugglers as they call themselves or whatever? I bet they do a lot of chems. If you don't mind shooting them, could you sniff around their camps, see how much litter of empty chem containers you find laying around? Maybe long-term effects of chem waste have affected the environment and how Lure Weed developed. Thanks."
lang["#MISSION_MELVIN_LITTER_HINT"] = "On Dead Estuary there are two Smuggler camps. A large encampment near the Trader Shack, and an outpost an on outer island. Invesigate them for chem litter."
lang["#MISSION_MELVIN_LITTER_COMPLETE"] = "So you DID find evidence of chem dumping? Oh shit let me see it. Very interesting, I hope you didn't get shot up too bad. I'll have to test some of these chem types on the Lure Weed and Anglers, see what happens. Here, have your pay and some stims too."

lang["#MISSION_MELVIN_PLASMA_DESC"] = "I got some spicy information. Apparently, there's this big rock formation in the further reaches of the swamp. No one knows who, but some guy or group keeps putting plasma mines up there. PLASMA. MINES. Deadly, and also very interesting. Who knows what washing in plasma blasts has possibly done to the plants around here, especially the Lure Weed! Look, I gotta test this out. Go get me some of those mines up there, just click the button really fast you'll be fine. Just don't lose your legs."
lang["#MISSION_MELVIN_PLASMA_HINT"] = "In the further reaches of the swamp, there's a large, rocky formation you can climb. Someone keeps putting Plasma Mines there, go get some."

Here, take this, you'll need it more than you'll need my money for what I'm thinking of down the line."

With you going in their camops, possibly killing them, and just causing all this ruckus around what they think is their swamp, it isn't good. They started stealing all the damn Lure Weed around, AND they've started to show up around the flotilla. Just staring with contempt for now, but who knows when they might try and get me! Just. Go deal with it. Please. I'm not a good fighter."
lang["#MISSION_MELVIN_CONTRABANNED_HINT"] = "The Smuggler camps around Dead Estuary contain large amounts of their numbers. Take them out, but be careful not to get overwhelmed."
lang["#MISSION_MELVIN_CONTRABANNED_COMPLETE"] = "You took care of it? Thank god. I hope this keeps them off my ass since you showed them whose boss around here. Remind me never to get on your bad side though, it takes some kind of monster to fight off that many raiders by themself."

It's called a Vertibird apparenty. Problem is, it's in the water, but the solution is I gave you that radiation suit! I know, I know, I'm a genius. Anyway, if you wanna go out to it, it's crashed off the waters of the back of the main Smuggler camp, where the boat is. Just head that way, and see if anything in the wreckage is fucking with the water and possibly messing with the Lure Weed and stuff. Don't drown though!"
lang["#MISSION_MELVIN_SWIMBIRDS_HINT"] = "Back behind the main Smuggler camp is a boat. Follow its direction to the water, and find the Vertibird crash. Bring back what you find."

Leaking nuclear fuel, plasma shit, microfusion, abunch of advanced tech stuff. All just stewing in the swamp water. Good job. I think with all this, I'm sure I can figure something concrete out. I might need your help still gathering supplies ocassionaly, maybe run back and get more chem waste and that stuff, but I think our main bulk is done. Thanks for all the help, $playername, you're one alright guy. I'll let Cascade Caravan know all you've done for me in my reports."
