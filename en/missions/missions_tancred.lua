Recently one of our brothers operating in the local region made a trip to a place known as the Yolla Bolla Mountain Range. Senior-Knight Mack was training to become a Paladin, Scribe Amy had descovered an important site deep in the mountain range. He was to scout out the area and report to us via radio communications. \n\n Last transmission we received from him he said he was being chased by... something. Its unclear what exactly was after him as the transmission was cut short. The only thing he did describe it as a devilish beast. It's been nearly a week since he's been gone. I have no doubt that he is dead. More than likely if he was alive but captured he would have atleast sent some type of sign. \n\nSo the mission is simple, Search the Yolla Bolla Mountain Range and recover the Holotag of Senior-Knight Mack. Afterwords bring it to me for your compensation. And while your at it, put down whatever beast killed him. Good luck."
