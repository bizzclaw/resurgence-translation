The 80s are largely autonomous, but my word is respected and is law... at least in theory. Our tribe bleeds, $playername. We are fractured and weakened. The truth of matters is that I need the aid of new blood. To survive the trials to come, the 80s must evolve. It needs... a catalyst.\n\nAre you prepared to become that catalyst, $playername?"
