		{"Summary", [[
This article of the Codex will summarize the entirety of the document into a few important points. This is to ensure swift access to all that is needed to be known by the average Brother of Steel.
These points are as follows:
	
1.) The Brotherhood of Steel is an organization dutybound to preserve, protect and advance the collective knowledge of mankind.
	
2.) Contrary to a popular misconception, the Brotherhood holds no ill-will against mutant-kind. All outsiders, human or otherwise, are kept at arm's length.
	
3.) The Brotherhood of Steel does not share its advanced technology with outsiders, but we are not opposed to trading lesser artifacts from the past.
	
4.) The Brotherhood of Steel is not a force for policing the Wasteland. Do not ask us to deal with the raiders harassing your farm.

		{"History", {

				{"High Elder Roger Maxson - 'The Great Deliverer'", [[
Roger Maxson is the original founder of the Brotherhood of Steel. Born in an unknown place, and at an unknown time, Maxson was once a Captain in the United States Army prior to the events of the Great War.
Second-in-command to Colonel Robert Spindel, the two men led a garrison of soldiers tasked with protecting the Mariposa Military Base. Following the Great War in 2077, Roger Maxson led his fellow soldiers and their families away from Mariposa to the underground facility known as Lost Hills. After establishing the Brotherhood of Steel, Maxson would serve as its first High Elder, dying of cancer in 2135. He would become a legend within the Brotherhood, eventually rising to a near deific status as the Great Deliverer of Mankind. He was survived by his son, Roger Maxson II.
				]]},
				{"Mariposa", [[ As mentioned previously, Maxson was a Captain in the garrison of the Mariposa Military Base. Assisting in the command of an unknown number of soldiers.
The soldiers guarding the base, including Maxson, were unaware of the research being conducted by the West-Tek employees they were protecting.
That changed when a guard named Edward Francis found an escaped test subject attempting to climb the perimeter fence. Francis shot the man, thinking he was a Chinese saboteur. He immediately reported his findings, only for the body to be gone when he returned with Maxson and others.
When the research team refused to allow the guards into the so-called “Red Levels” of the base to search for signs of intrusion, Maxson grew suspicious.

Looking into the base documents, Maxson found records of extra supply shipments sent to the base that were not recorded in the inventory logs, or at the loading bay.

Bringing this to Colonel Spindel, Maxson was encouraged to drop his investigation, but this did very little to prevent the young Captain from digging into the base’s underbelly. Frustrated with the lack of concern from his superior, Maxson gathered several fellow guards and approached the entrance to the Red Level.
Ordering the researchers to let him in, Maxson was denied. Not accepting this, he made use of his T-51b power armor and forced the door open. Entering, he and his men soon made a grizzly discovery.
That being the FEV experimentation, in awe and horror at the sight, Maxson had the research team seized as traitors to the United States.

The preceding days were tense and confusing, with nobody on base able to truly comprehend the inhumanity they had witnessed. Maxson ordered his men to keep the revelation a secret from their families (who lived in on-base housing), but when Colonel Spindel suffered a mental break, and locked himself in his office, Maxson was forced to explain to all why it had happened.
Maxson and his men opted to break into the Colonel’s office, for almost a day nothing could be heard from inside but their commander's cries and sobs. Entering the office, they saw Spindel at his desk, pistol in hand. His last words being, “I swear, I didn’t know,” before taking his life.
				]]},
				{"The Mutiny", [[
Left in charge by the Colonel’s demise, Maxson was flooded with demands for answers from his men. Maxson would personally interrogate the captured researchers, beginning with Robert Anderson and ending with Erin Shellman.
Each told Maxson the same story, and each insisted on its validity: West-Tek has been contracted by the United States government to research a gene-altering serum, dubbed the Forced Evolutionary Virus (FEV), using research from the previous Pan-Immunity Virion project, which was launched in the wake of the New Plague.
To achieve this they were given clearance to test their prototype serums on military “volunteers,” Chinese POWs, and federal prisoners.

Unwilling to accept this version of events, Maxson executed the researchers, but did not give up on his search for answers. On October 20th, 2077, Maxson would announce on an open radio channel that he and his men were defecting from the United States Army, and were currently in a state of mutiny over the mistreatment of human lives they had witnessed.
Maxson understood war, and that people kill one another to achieve victory, but to devalue the sanctity of human life to gain an uncertain advantage in a war that already seemed over was unacceptable.
Even if the lives being devalued were their enemies. Maxson would receive no response from his superiors or any other members of the U.S. Armed Forces.

On October 23, 2077, Maxson called the head of the West-Tek research department, Leon von Felden, who would confirm the story told by the other researchers.
Shocked by this confirmation, Maxson was surprised when the line suddenly fell silent. The nukes had dropped, and Leon’s office, now known as the Glow, was among the first targets.

Journals found after the death of Roger Maxson indicated that he felt remorse for his killing of the researchers. They told the truth, and he executed them.
He ordered them to be properly buried at the base, and remembered each of their names even up to his death decades later.
				]]},
				{"Exodus", [[
After the sounds of the first bombing wave fell silent, Maxson gathered his men to form a plan for the future. Understanding that they could no longer stay at the base, fearing an attack in the Chinese’s second wave, they opted to make for the less significant bunker installation to the southeast: Lost Hills.
Sgt. Platner, a man under Maxson’s command, volunteered to leave the base and find a passable route that was free of radiation. He would return with results, and Maxson gave the order to leave.

A team of men under Sgt. Dennis Allen would implore Maxson to let them investigate the ruins of the West-Tek Offices for valuable technology.
Ignoring Maxson’s warnings not to, they departed anyway, and were never seen again.

A band of raiders, simply known as the Marauders, targeted the caravan. They had no hope of defeating the guards in their power armor, but these raiders were easily able to target the unarmed civilians and family members who accompanied them. Many would die during the Exodus, including Roger Maxson’s own wife, Olivia.

Arriving at Lost Hills, Maxson and his caravan established themselves in the underground levels. Using captured construction equipment, they would expand the bunker with new levels and chambers, adapting it to their needs.
The small, unassuming concrete shelter on the surface would soon bely the impressive fortress built underneath by the survivors.
				]]},
				{"The Founding", [[
The Brotherhood of Steel would be established sometime after the Exodus. Much of the order’s early history is unknown. One recorded event is the reconnection of Roger Maxson with a fellow member of the United States Army, one whom he had served with prior to the Great War, A U.S. Army Ranger by the name of Elizabeth Taggerdy. At the time, she and her unit were based in Appalachia, and would, under the guidance of Roger Maxson, form the Appalachian Chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel. In the following years, Maxson would keep in touch with the fledgling chapter under Paladin Taggerdy, and would lose contact with her sometime in the year 2095.
It is unknown what happened to the chapter beyond that, they had previously reported of another cataclysmic threat to mankind brewing in the east: The Scorched Plague. Despite attempts to uncover the fate of the Appalachian Chapter, none ever returned.

Roger Maxson would encourage the BOS to remain an open organization, willing to bring in new members from the local population.
Many others in Lost Hills, including his own son, would instead argue that the Brotherhood needed to isolate itself from the outside world, and lock its library of knowledge and technology away from the "outsiders."
None would directly confront Maxson, out of respect, but he would remain the minority in the matter up until his death.
				]]},
				{"Maxson II", [[
Maxson II, otherwise known as Roger Maxson II, was born in the mid 2060’s. He was the only child of Roger Maxson, the first High Elder. Maxson II succeeded his father as High Elder in 2135 at roughly the age of 53.
The Brotherhood of Steel would change dramatically with him as High Elder. The Brotherhood stopped letting in new members, relying on its current population to reproduce and make new members.

Brotherhood society also changed under Maxson II. Members were organized into three Castes.
Scribes were relegated to research and development, to preserving ancient technology and knowledge; to medical practices, and general administration.
Knights were moved from an infantry force, to a corps of engineers and craftsmen.
Security was left to the noble Paladins, who were “honored” with the Brotherhood’s valuable power armor.
The Brotherhood would evolve from a military order meant to steward the new world, to a mysterious secret society that fully dedicated itself to preservation. Sentiments had shifted since the Great War. Many in the Brotherhood turned away from other survivors.
The people Roger Maxson saw as his fellow Americans were now, simply, “Outsiders.”

Maxson II’s High Eldership is by far the most mysterious, nearly nothing is known about the events he oversaw. All that is ever spoken about in lectures within the bunker are the Vipers.
The Vipers were a tribe local to the Lost Hills region; they had carved out a domain around the Brotherhood’s home in the decades following the Great War, raiding and pillaging villages and caravans in the name of their snake god. Some speculation claims the Vipers were descended from the Marauders who had harried the Brotherhood convoy during the Exodus and killed Maxson II’s mom.
Some say that he desired revenge, others claim the Brotherhood simply wished to re-establish itself as a power in the Wasteland. Either way, in 2155, at roughly the age of 90, Maxson II would lead a team of Paladins into combat against the Vipers, slaughtering many of their tribal warriors. It was not long after this that, in a moment of overconfidence, Maxson II removed his helmet, and was cut by a venomous Viper arrow. Something that would lead to his demise not long after.

In the wake of Maxson II’s passing, his son, John (born 2097), would be selected as the new High Elder. Senior Paladin Rhombus, a friend of John, would earn his place as the Brotherhood’s new Head Paladin by leading a full campaign against the Viper remnants, massacring them and scattering them into the Wasteland.
The Vipers continue on as a shadow in the Wastes, where they would never again threaten anyone else, especially the Brotherhood. It was during this campaign that the Brotherhood found the Hub, and established trade with the Wasteland for the first time since Roger Maxson first founded the organization.
				]]},
				{"High Elder John Maxson", [[
Much of John Maxson’s High Eldership is overshadowed by the Unity Crisis. What few instructors teach to their students in the chapters today is that John Maxson was far more outwardly focused than his father, though he was never quite as charitable to outsiders as his grandfather.
John believed in what he referred to as an “Appropriate Distance” between the Wasteland and the Brotherhood of Steel. Recognizing that the order was founded for the sake of the outside world, but knowing that it also exists because of the outside world, and must maintain a necessary boundary.
As such, he opened the Brotherhood to new members, but only those who could demonstrate an almost unreasonable devotion to an order they were not part of. By undertaking a dangerous quest to the Glow, the ruins of the former West-Tek offices. Any who would do so successfully were, in his eyes, truly worthy of the Brotherhood of Steel.
Few ever tried to make the journey, even fewer returned.
					
John Maxson is remembered now as a good man who was simply ill-suited for the politics of his position.
His policies ultimately strengthened the Brotherhood by reconnecting them with a world Maxson II had largely left behind.
				]]},
				{"The Unity Crisis", [[
In 2161, in the second year of John Maxson's High Eldership, a stranger would arrive at Lost Hills. Like many who attempted to join the Brotherhood before him, this man would be sent to die searching for technology in the Glow.
To the surprise of everyone in the bunker, this stranger, draped in a blue jumpsuit, would actually return. Keeping their word, the Brotherhood accepted him as a new Initiate.
This person, now known to history as the Vault Dweller, or the Man from Vault 13, would help John Maxson prove to the Elder Council that the Brotherhood was being threatened by a growing force of mutants in the north, in the ruins of a place called “Mariposa.”

Most in the Brotherhood had forgotten the old base, Roger Maxson never mentioned it after the Exodus, nor did he invoke the FEV experiments when founding the Brotherhood of Steel.
Head Scribe Vree would be invaluable in uncovering the origin and nature of these new “Super Mutants.” Despite the threat to Lost Hills, the other Elders would insist on remaining underground, hidden away in the bunker. John Maxson, however, pushed for the Brotherhood to take action.

With proof from the Vault Dweller, the Elder Council finally relented and approved a strike team of Paladins to be formed and sent to destroy Mariposa and another location, one said to house the mutants’ leader: the Cathedral.
With aid from the Brotherhood, the Vault Dweller eradicated the Unity, sending them fleeing into the Wasteland.
				]]},
				{"High Elder Rhombus", [[
As Head Paladin under High Elder John Maxson, Rhombus served valiantly in the conflict between the Brotherhood and the Unity. He would be known from a strict view of the Codex and the Brotherhood’s mission.
Rhombus succeeded John Maxson as High Elder, the first outside the Maxson bloodline to hold the position. Rhombus would continue his mentor’s legacy turning the Brotherhood into more of an active force in the Wasteland. Under High Elder Rhombus, the Brotherhood of Steel would become a major hub for research and development in the region; and through his establishment of trade with the blossoming New California Republic, Rhombus’ Brotherhood would begin returning technology to the Wasteland.

Rhombus would order the construction of smaller observation bunkers across the California Wasteland. Building underground outposts in places like Shady Sands (the NCR capital), the Den, and San Francisco. This would introduce the Brotherhood to another society of the new world, one that could match their technological might: the Shi. The Brotherhood would use these bunkers initially to trade technology.
Despite Rhombus’ efforts to acclimate the Brotherhood to the Wasteland, the organization would soon grow paranoid, and these bunkers would develop a new purpose: to keep tabs on the other factions of the Wasteland. This was primarily to keep the Brotherhood informed of the events in the region, as they actively avoided the growing political struggles between the NCR, the Shi, and Vault City.
				]]},
				{"High Elder Jeremy Maxson", [[
Grandson of John Maxson, Jeremy would become High Elder after the death of Rhombus in 2230. Jeremy would inherit a thriving Brotherhood. Under his supervision the Brotherhood of Steel would begin to expand to other regions of the post-war United States. Rhombus had attempted to send the Brotherhood eastward decades prior, with a failed expedition to Chicago.
Jeremy Maxson would follow suit with further expeditions east and north. Under his expansionist mentality, the Brotherhood would establish new chapters in Colorado, Nevada, Oregon, and Montana. Jeremy Maxson would continue the policies of Rhombus and would return technology to the Wasteland through controlled trade with the NCR, the Shi, and Vault City. As of the time of this data entry (Oct. 12, 2236) Jeremy Maxson is the sitting High Elder of the Brotherhood of Steel.

⦁	Do not commit violence upon a Brother of Steel.

⦁	Honor all oaths, fulfill all promises.

⦁	Comport with dignity, integrity, and respect for all Brothers.

⦁	Protect all knowledge, all technology, even from your brethren.

The Chain That Binds is a fundamental principle of the Brotherhood of Steel. It reinforces the shared bonds of fellowship that unite every Brother of Steel in their quest to safekeep the knowledge of humanity.
This doctrine dictates that orders flow down the Brotherhood’s hierarchy, never skipping any in the chain of command. This ensures clarity amongst the members of the Brotherhood and prevents any from having their authority undermined.

The Chain That Binds also compels members to obey any and all orders from a superior that do not conflict with Brotherhood principles, tenets, or morals.
This preserves the integrity and intent of the Brotherhood, and ensures purity of ideology among its members. The doctrine was originally formed by Roger Maxson as a means of maintaining order in Lost Hills, but has evolved over time to effectively fill the role of backbone to the Brotherhood’s core beliefs.

			{"The Vault Dweller's Memoirs", [[
Due to the efforts of Paladin Mayner and Journeymen-Scribe Lenny they were able to recover the last recorded message of the lengendary Vault Dweller.
After discovering the village of Arroyo and with the tribal elders permission we were granted a copy of the memoir. All information recorded below is a one-to-one copy of the original writing transcribe by the Head Scribe and several other Senior Scribes at Lost Hills. It has been shared publicly on the Brotherhood communications network.

"The one good thing about growing old is that you get your way. The new leaders of the Tribe (they refuse to call themselves Elders until I have passed on, which should be soon, if I'm lucky) want me to record my knowledge for future generations. Bah! What knowledge they need is to be found with sweat and blood, not some letters on a page. But the future is a great unknown, and they may have a point. To make them happy, I've written down what I feel will be important. (The important words being "what I feel will be important.")

They want me to write my memoirs. Fine. I'll do it. But as the song goes, I'll do it my way. And I'm old enough that I will get my way.

The War
I know little about the War, but it doesn't really matter. A lot of people died when a lot of atomic bombs went off and nearly destroyed the world. If you don't know what an atomic bomb is, then imagine the worst thing possible. Atomic bombs were worse than that.

The Vaults
Like all of the original members of the Tribe, I came from the Vaults. Before the War, the government of the United States, which numbered in the thousands of villages, and had many, many tribesman per village, paid to have these huge holes dug in mountains and huts of metal and stone built underground. There were many Vaults. Some were close to cities, and some far away. These Vaults were to be used as safe places in case of atomic war. As you may guess, when the War came your ancestors made it to a Vault. Vault 13 to be specific.

For several generations, your ancestors and mine lived within the Vault. As best as they could figure, it was too dangerous to try and leave the Vault. They grew their own food, recycled their waste, read, worked, slept, had families, and even purified the necessary water within the Vault. I was born in the creche, and was raised by the community (and a robot). It was a good life, but all good things come to an end. About three generations after the War, the water-purification chip the Vault relied on to create the fresh water broke down. All the spare parts were missing or busted, and without the water-chip the Vault was doomed. Something had to be done.

The Overseer gathered the healthy of us between a certain age and made us draw straws. Guess what? I drew the short one. Wouldn't be much of a story if I didn't, would it?

I left the Vault the next day.

Life on the Outside
My first few days were harrowing to say the least. I fought off some giant mutant rats that were more interested in eating me than they should have been.
My only clue was the location of another Vault, number 15. I spent a couple of days stumbling through the desert before I came upon a small settlement. I stopped there for help, and encountered the little town called Shady Sands. I helped them, and they helped me. Understand that survival requires that you work together, even with people you may not trust. I did earn the trust, however, of two prominent citizens of Shady Sands - Tandi, and her father, Aradesh.

With their knowledge, and the help of a man called Ian, I continued on my way to Vault 15. The ruins of Vault 15, to be more specific. Ravaged by the elements, scavengers, and time itself, Vault 15 was no help for my people. The control room that contained their water-chip was buried under tons of fallen rock, and I had to move on.

After a small problem with some raiders, who would continue for years to plague not only myself, but the Tribe, I found myself in Junktown. It was here that I learned the most important rule of all: doing a good thing sometimes means being a very bad person. My memories of Junktown are tainted, and I feel no remorse for my actions in that place. It was there that I came across a dog, who adopted me and was my faithful friend from there on. I miss Dogmeat to this day.

While Junktown was a city of traders (and traitors), it did not have a water-chip. I was not desperate yet, as there was still time for me to recover the chip and return to my home, but I needed to move on. Fortunately, they pointed me in the direction of the Hub, the largest city in the wasteland.

The Hub was a larger city than both Junktown and Shady Sands combined. You could drop the Vault in there, and you probably would not notice. But the people of the Hub had no life, and it was a desolate place just the same. It eased my mind, however, to hire some merchants to bring water to the Vault. Looking back, it was probably a mistake to do so, but I was still innocent of the evils that lurked through the ruins of civilization. A small clue led me to the city of the ghouls, the place they called Necropolis. It was there that I encountered large mutants, armed with weapons of an unknown origin. It is with heavy sadness that I say that Ian lost his life in the city of the dead. A super mutant burned him to death with a flamethrower. The passage of time is no proof against the memory of burning flesh. His sacrifice was not in vain, as I did find the water-chip buried beneath the city. It was with easier steps that I returned to Vault 13.

Enemies of the State
While the Overseer was obviously happy to see me returned to the Vault, alive and with the necessary water-chip, he was distraught at my description of the super mutants. It is here that I realized the mistake I had made with the water-merchants. I had pointed them, and others, in the direction of our home. Without the protection of anonymity, the Vault could easily have been destroyed. The knowledge of the fate of Vault 15 did not help. The Overseer tasked me with a new mission. Find and destroy the danger of the super mutants. Once again, I left the Vault. This time, it was easier on my heart. Looking back now, I realize it was also the first time I should have seen the true hearts of the other vault dwellers and the Overseer.

I returned to the Hub, looking for clues. Some time was spent there, and I discovered a shady underworld amongst the hustle and bustle of that large city. They thought they could manipulate me, but I proved them wrong and used the crooks instead. I did rescue a young man who belonged to the Brotherhood of Steel. A few trouble-makers tried to stop me, but I learned much about survival since leaving the Vault.

It was in my best interest to leave town for a while. I journeyed to this Brotherhood. Thinking they would have the knowledge I sought, I tried to join them. They required me to go on a quest before they would let me in. Thinking it would be a short and easy quest, I agreed and set off for the place they called the Glow. The horror of atomic war was never so obvious to me until then. The Brotherhood was surprised to see me, and even more surprised to see that I had not only survived their quest, but succeeded. They gave me the information I required and some of their technology, and I set off in search of the Boneyard. On my way, I took a detour and stopped by Necropolis in order to see some old friends. Unfortunately, that place was now truly the city of the dead. All the ghouls had been slaughtered. Large mutants roamed the streets. I found one survivor who told me that the mutants had attacked shortly after I had left. Before he died, the ghoul told me that the mutants were looking for pure strain humans, and one in particular. The ghoul's description of the mutants' special target fit me perfectly. It was with a heavy heart and a cold burning on my soul that I continued on to Boneyard.

The Master
The city of Los Angeles must have been the largest in the world before the War. The LA Boneyard stretched forever, the skeletons of buildings lying under the hot sun. Not even the wind entered this dead city.

I found many enemies, and a few friends, in the Boneyard. I killed when necessary and learned more about the nature of my true foes. Deep under the ground, I found an evil that was behind the mutants and their army. Within a dark and forbidding Vault, where the walls dripped with human flesh, and the screams of the dying echoed through the halls, I found many evil creatures and mutants.

Walking among the misshapen ones, I killed one of their servants and took his clothing. Hidden from casual searches, I made my way to the bottom of the Vault. The deeper into the Vault I went, the more gruesome the journey. More and more flesh was to be found, integrated into the very walls. The worst part of it was that the flesh was still alive, and even aware of my presence.

After a while, I found myself in the presence of the most hideous sight yet. I still cannot bring myself to write of this discovery, but let it be known that when I left, the Beast was dead and the Master of the mutant army was no more.

The Vats
My job was still not finished, for I still had one task remaining. The Master had literally built his army one mutant at a time. Humans, preferably with little radiation damage, were to be captured and sent to the Vats. There they were dipped in something called FEV, which transformed them into the large, grotesque mutants.

I had to find these Vats, and put them out of action as well, lest another take the Master's place and continue to build the mutant army. Fortunately, my friends at the Brotherhood had a few clues, and helped me reach my goal. Invading the Vats, I came across more mutants and robots. None could stand in my way. I had a mission. I had a goal. I had a really large gun. It was here that Dogmeat fell, a victim of a powerful energy forcefield. I miss that dog. I destroyed the Vats that day, and with it, the mutant army. The last I heard, they splintered and disappeared into the desert.

My Return to Vault 13
I was not treated to a hero's welcome when I returned to Vault 13. The Overseer met me outside the massive Vault door, and told me point blank that while my services to the Vault will always be remembered, he could no longer trust me or what I had become. He said something along the lines that I had saved the Vault, and now I must leave. Bastard.

And so, I left.

The days and weeks that followed were hard on me. I had met few true friends outside the Vault, and they had died following me. Now, my family had kicked me out and said that I could never return. I screamed. I cried. Slowly I came to realize that the Overseer may have been correct. I had changed. Life outside the Vault was different, and now I, too, was different. But I have never forgiven him for doing what he did to me.

I wandered the desert, but never moved far from the mountains that shielded the Vault from the rest of the world. Perhaps I wanted to return, and force my way in, or plead for them to take me back. Fortunately, it did not come to that. I found a few wretched souls, a small group of Vault dwellers, who upon hearing of what happened to me, had decided to leave the Vault and join my side. They knew little of the outside world, and would have died if it were not for my assistance.

Together, our little group moved north, away from the Vault, and away from that old life. Slowly, I taught them what experience had taught me. And together we learned to thrive.

The Tribe
Over time, our ragtag group turned into a tribe. I fell in love with one of them, and we raised a family, like all of our tribes people.

We founded the Village, beyond the great cliff. It is a secure home thanks to our hard work. We would send scouts back towards the Vault, to help others who thought like ourselves, but that slowly came to an end. We no longer head in that direction. I often wonder what became of Vault 13, and the other Vaults, but I never had the time to go exploring again.

I taught the others the skills they would need to survive and grow strong. Hunting, farming and other skills to feed us. Engineering and science to build our homes. Fighting to protect what was ours.

My love and I led the village and the Tribe. The Tribe grew, and grew strong with our help. But all things come to an end. Our sons and daughters are now the leaders. I'm sure that the Tribe will continue to grow strong under the leadership of our children.

My love perished years ago, and not a day goes by that I do not think of Pat's face. I see it every time I look at our children. This journal is our legacy to them, to their children, and to the rest of the Tribe. That is my story, and I am sticking to it.

Senior Scribe Beatrix's Note: The original copy of this holotape video has been lost but several referances have been made throughout pre-war terminals and logs. It seems like this holotape video was about a incident on a pre-war satellite about a strange and deadly creature getting aboard through one of the engineers and starts killing all of the crew one by one. Eventually one survivor stopped it and vented it in to space. And also somehow a cat is involved. Not much else is known, sadly.

For now this is all that can be gathered about it through my reserach. The tape was quite popular among U.S. soldiers pre-war and had a lasting impact on the culture at the time. It's seems to be about U.S. Soldiers defending base from large mutated insects (sounds quite familiar to our situation.) And that "service guarantees citizenship." It ultimately tried to parody some of the U.S. politics at the time and got banned from several theaters and was labeled as communist propaganda. Quite an interesting video if we could get it to work.

Seriously, I have no clue why so much effort was spent on these things since it seems to just be a marketing scheme to get people to buy action figures. Several books I have read (and reread again) have overlapped and invalidated plot points from other books. I am taking a break from these damn things.

			{"New California Republic", [[
The New California Republic (NCR) is a nation formed in the loose image of the pre-war American government. They cling to values of democracy, diplomacy, and freedom. Their current leader: President Tandi, holds her office in the nation's capital of Shady Sands. Tandi values diplomacy over force, and maintains a positive relationship with the Elder Council. The NCR's forces in Northern California and Southern Oregon are based out of a small desert town called Salt Wells.
The NCR is a relatively new nation. Founded by former residents of Vault 15, they have grown into a burgeoning power in the Wasteland. Tandi has been working for decades to expand their borders through peaceful diplomacy, an effort that has borne varying results. The main powers of the NCR have maintained positive ties with the Brotherhood for decades, and have been granted limited access to our knowledge and technology.
The NCR employs an arsenal of weaponry that is reminiscent of pre-war artifacts. Troopers are often seen wielding the R91 Assault Rifle, AK-110 Service Rifle, the MG-75 Light Machine Gun. Certain units, such as their elite Rangers, have been seen wielding much older firearms, such as Browning Automatic Rifle, and BFR Revolver. Overall, they employ a variety of ballistic weaponry; but have very limited access to energy-based weaponry.
The NCR makes use of a variety of armor patterns. Their standard infantry is the most uniformed, with the average trooper wearing an area appropriate field jacket and gaiters. Aramid vests are provided to protect the soldier from stabs and small arms fire. A steel brodie helmet is provided to every soldier in the NCR infantry. Specialized units, such as Riot Control Officers and Heavy Troopers, are often equipped with suits of combat armor. This armor is often scavenged, or acquired through trades with the Brotherhood of Steel. NCR Rangers don various unforms, often trading protection for mobility. Patrol Armor protects against most melee weapons and larger caliber fire arms. Their pride and joy, however, is the NCR Ranger Riot Armor, typically only given to Veteran Rangers. This pre-war riot is practically immune to most melee weapons, and offers great protection from gunfire. However, most rangers issued the armor forgo the use of the leg plates for the sake of mobility and stealth in the field.
At this time, the Elder Council does not know of any suits of power armor in common use by the NCR; nor does the faction seem capable or close to capable of producing even basic suits, such as the T-45d. However, the Brotherhood gifted one such suit to the NCR some years ago, which the faction garishly modified into a ceremonial uniform. This suit has since been issued to the NCR's regional commander. It may be possible for other members of the NCR to find and use suits of power armor.
The NCR have been known to collaborate with local factions and settlements, adhering to President Tandi's policy of diplomacy. If provoked, however, the NCR are known to strike back with immense force and ferocity. However, the NCR reliance of cooperated with local groups has led them to associate with factions considered less than reputable by the Brotherhood of Steel, such as the Van Graffs and Cipher Company.

As stated before, the NCR maintains a positive relationship with the Brotherhood of Steel.
The NCR control the area in and around Salt Wells. They also maintain a presence within the Mountain Pass via Camp Willow. Previously, the NCR kept forces in the Yolla Valley, but have since left the region in the hands of the Valley Survivalists and the Desert Rangers.
Based on our assessments, it is believed the NCR poses a minimal threat to the Brotherhood of Steel due to their history of positive and productive interaction.
			]]},
			{"Phoenix Company", [[
The Phoenix Company are a rather complex organization. Their origins are largely unknown. Some Scribes speculate that their founders may have been residents of a vault, but this remains unconfirmed. The PC have been observed utilizing complex military formations and communications, as well as tactics and strategies. This, coupled with their military-grade equipment, makes them a considerable force against many other factions in the Wasteland.
The primary base of operations for the Phoenix Company is known to be in the ruins of Salem, Oregon; where they are locked in a stalemate against the remnants of the Master's Army.
The Phoenix Company rely on an extensive hierarchy, with ranks that seem mostly pulled from the Old World Military. Their current known leader is called General Shepherd. Alongside him are officers with ranks like Major, Colonel, and Warrant Officer.
Regarding weapons and armor, the PC are among the more advanced factions of the Wasteland. Though they are not quite as well equipped as the Brotherhood, they generally outmatch the NCR and DR in terms of quality of equipment. They are able to dress most of their members, even new recruits, in suits of combat armor. They also possess a proprietary armor made from various polymers and plating, which they refer to as mercenary armor. They have also been seen wielding a combination of ballistic and energy weapons.
The PC are known to plant members of their organization into other factions to act as moles and informants. Institutions such as the Desert Rangers and NCR Military have been warned to select new recruits with care.
While the Brotherhood has made an effort to aid the PC in their fight against the Unity, and to collaborate for the betterment of mankind, the PC seem determined to create conflict between their company and our order. After a case of mistaken identity caused a Knight to fire on PC soldiers, they declared hostilities on the Brotherhood of Steel. As such, the Phoenix Company have been deemed hostile with the Brotherhood of Steel.
The Phoenix Company are considered an extreme threat to the Brotherhood. Their equipment and training make them a standout among the Brotherhood's growing list of enemies. Do not underestimate them. 
			]]},
			{"Unity Chosen", [[
The Unity (also known as the Master's Army) is a religious, paramilitary organization that once plagued the Wasteland of Southern California. They first appeared around the ruins of the Mariposa Military Base and in the vicinity of a ruined church within the Boneyard called the Cathedral.
Their former bases at Mariposa and the Cathedral were destroyed by an Initiate of the Brotherhood in 2161. During this campaign, the brave Initiate personally slew both the Master and the Lieutenant of this cult-like army. This Initiate, known to the Wasteland as the Vault Dweller, has since vanished and is no longer available for further reports on the Unity.
Currently, the Unity are inhabiting an abandoned metro station in the ruined city of Salem, Oregon. They are in an intense stalemate against the Phoenix Company for control of the ruins.
Regarding their hierarchy, the Brotherhood believes the Unity consists of two primary components. The Master's Army is made up of mostly of super mutants and ghoulish devotees. Alongside them, there are the Children of the Cathedral, a priesthood composed of humans and ghouls who have sworn allegiance to the Master.
The Children of the Cathedral, prior to the revelation of the Master's existence, were viewed as an eccentric cult who engrossed themselves in the local communities by offering medical services. Behind this veneer of charity was a hidden effort to convert any who would listen to the cause of the Master and his Unity.
In the wild, the Unity have been observed using a variety of ranks. In the days of the Master, they were Lieutenants, Commanders, and Captains. Some speculate that they have forgone the lengthy use of titles, relying instead on names and distinguishing only those members in the priesthood. However, some reports mention members referring to one another as Warlord, Overlord, etc.
The current leader of the Unity is unknown. However, members of the Unity have been known to chant the name Gilgamesh in battle. The Scribes claim this may their leader, perhaps even a new godhead that they have invented.
Regarding their equipment, the Unity have access to military-grade pre-war weapons, alongside advanced energy weapons platforms taken from the research labs at Mariposa and its surrounding depots. While the Brotherhood claimed many of these armaments in the aftermath of the Unity's defeat, their elite warriors have been spotted wielding some of what remains. While most members of the Unity dress themselves in crude armor made from scraps of metal, reports mention that at least some have taken to wearing broken power armor pieces as body armor. Should such a foe be encountered, our brothers are encouraged to avoid targeting these parts of the body. Powered or not, those pieces still provide immense protection.
While the Brotherhood holds no ill will against the mutants of the Wasteland, and was content to allow the Unity to live out their remaining days in peace, they have made that impossible. Frequent attacks against the Brotherhood, as well as their destruction of valuable history and knowledge have made their intentions clear. They mean harm, and The Brotherhood must defend itself. As such, the Unity are considered hostile, and are elevated to an extreme threat against the Brotherhood. Do not face this foe lightly, Brothers. Their mutant population, coupled with a religious zeal and technological capacity, make them a formidable enemy.

			{"80s Tribe", [[
The 80's Tribe (or simply, the 80's) are gang of unkempt freebooters known to roam about the Wasteland on the backs of ramshackle motorbikes and behind the wheel of piecemeal buggies. This clan of dirty vagabonds prey on the weak and helpless. They mask their banditry behind claims of freedom and self-determination, but it's ultimately a poor veneer for their selfish and destructive desires.
Roaming the desert landscape of Salt Wells, the 80's are a staunch rival of both the New California Republic and the Desert Rangers, opposing their efforts to pacify the region and establish some form of lawful order.
Regarding hierarchy, the 80's are poorly organized and lack any chain of command that would make them capable of more than base survival. This system seems serviceable for them, as their ambitions seem largely relegated to Salt Wells.
The 80's are led by an individual simply referred to as the Queen of Rust. Little is known about this person, but their followers seem fiercely loyal to them.
Regarding equipment, the 80's dress in crude armor shambled together with scraps of rusted metal and damaged leather. Some have been seen with primitive respirators made from oil filters taped to their hoods and masks, presumably to filter out dust in the air, and the smoke of their poorly made vehicles. Some members have managed to throw together low-quality power armor frames, which they have bolted layers of scrap metal and old car parts onto. This results in a grossly unsightly, but mildly effective suit of power armor. This is restricted primarily to what they would consider to be their elite warriors. As far as weapons go, the 80's largely employ crude ballistic and melee weapons.
The Brotherhood of Steel does not concern itself with the law and order, or lack thereof, within the Wasteland. We leave the duty of taming this moribund world to the NCR and Desert Rangers. However, these fiends have been foolish enough to assail Brotherhood Paladins in the field. They were swiftly defeated at every turn, but their lack of learning a lesson has forced the Brotherhood to engage in formal hostilities with them.
Overall, the Elder Council deems the 80's to be a modest threat to the Brotherhood. They cannot hope to match our technological and intellectual superiority, but they do boast numbers and a slightly admirable refusal to concede defeat. Never underestimate a foe, but try not to overestimate the 80's Tribe.
			]]},
			{"Cipher Company", [[
The Cipher Company is a criminal organization. Comprised of vandals, racketeers, information brokers, smugglers, thieves, and other types of undesirables. 
Their leader refers to himself as Greebus. This uncouth fiend and his band of thugs prey on the weak and helpless, and aid some of the most revolting individuals in the Wasteland.
Cipher Company members have been seen in the area of Mountain Pass. Scribes poured through past reports made by Paladins on patrol and found one mentioning a secondary bunker in the valley. This location is believed to be there current base of operations.
The Ciphers seem to lack any sense of uniformity. While most members don pre-war suits in a crude attempt to look reputable, their arsenal of weapons is an utter hodgepodge. Members have been seen wielding advanced energy weapons, crude melee devices, pre-war rifles, and rusted blades. It would seem, based on this fact, that members source their own weapons. This could suggest a lack of extensive logistical support.
The most advanced items known to be possessed by the Ciphers are various Chinese Stealth Suits, which they use to commit their fiendish deeds unseen. It is believed that they may have stolen these suits from the Shi of San Francisco. However, the Brotherhood has discovered small safehouses used by Chinese spies prior to the Great War, it is not unlikely that the Ciphers found these as well, and took the suits from there.
The Brotherhood of Steel is not an instrument of law and order, but the Ciphers foolish attempts to extort Brotherhood members, and their attacks on Paladin patrols have made their nature more than clear. By their own hand, they have been declared hostile to the Brotherhood of Steel.
Unlike the Rockbiters or the 80's, the Cipher Company is no ordinary band of raiders. They are considered an extreme threat to the Brotherhood. Their expertise in subterfuge, coupled with their stealth suits and access to advanced weaponry make them capable opponents. Do not underestimate this foe.
The Brotherhood Prevails
			]]},
			{"Rock-Biters", [[
The Rockbitersare a gang of raiders from the Yolla Valley. They have developed a reputation for tormenting and harassing lone travelers and lightly-protected caravans passing through the region. They claim to desire independence and self-determination, but have chosen to do so at the expense of all neighboring settlements.
The Rockbiters live in the abandoned mines on the southern end of the Yolla Valley. Their presence greatly chagrins the Valley Survivalists and Desert Rangers, who wish to keep up the flow of free and prosperous trade in the area. However, the heavily entrenched Rockbiters have proven difficult to dislodge from their cavernous fortress.
The Rockbiters seem to have some form of association with the pre-war miners who once lived and worked in the region. Whether they are the descendants of such people, or merely adopted their heritage as a cultural identity, is not entirely known. What few attempts have been made to contact this tribe have only led to conflict.
This identity they have assumed can be seen through the hierarchy they maintain. Their leader is referred to as the Superintendent and other members hold titles such as Forgemaster or Dust Rat.
Regarding equipment, the Rockbiters possess a large stockpile of refurbished mining equipment. Among this arsenal are repurposed suits of Excavator Power Armor, some of which they have reinforced with extra plating. They also make use of sealed mining suits and vehicles. Some members have also been seen wearing the makeshift pattern of power armor often seen in possession of other raider clans in the Wasteland. The Rockbiters use any weapons they can find, but have access to a large amount of explosives and explosive weapons.
The Brotherhood has kept a close eye on the Rockbiters, due to the factions access to more potent suits of power armor in comparison to the other raiders south of Mountain Pass. Their clan was largely inconsequential due to constant shifts in leadership. However, they have recently debuted a new commander, and appear to be preparing to make serious moves in the Wasteland.
Officially, the Rockbiters have made themselves hostile with the Brotherhood of Steel. The Elder Council has designated them to be a modest threat to the Brotherhood. While they are an untrained, disorganized band of thugs; they still possess sophisticated sets of armor. Brothers are urged to exercise appropriate caution when dealing with them.
			]]},
			{"Desert Rangers", [[
The Desert Rangers are a loosely organized company of survivalists and self-appointed lawmen. Originating from parts of pre-war Arizona and Nevada, the DR have members spread across much of the post-war west and southwest.
Individuals claiming to be members of the Desert Rangers have been mentioned in various tales and stories throughout the Wasteland, including one who allegedly aided in the destruction of the Master's Army. It is believed that the legendary reputation of the Desert Rangers may have been a key influence for the formation of the NCR's own Ranger Corps.
At face value, the Desert Rangers are a versatile and skilled organization. However, they lack a rigid sense of organization, with members allowed a high amount of autonomy and freedom. Each member is allowed to enforce their own sense of justice and order, so long as they remain with the scope of reason. The Desert Rangers have regional leaders known as Ranger-Commanders, these individuals hold their agents accountable and report to the Ranger Chief. The current Ranger Chief goes by the name Vargas.
In terms of weaponry, the DR appear to be on a similar technological level as the New California Republic. Like the NCR, they employ a wide range of ballistic weaponry, though the autonomy afforded to each member, and the required self-reliance that comes with it, means each member is capable of wield all manner of weapons. Though they are often seen carrying a Browning Automatic Rifle, the FNR-53, various high powered revolvers, and a modified 14.5mm lever action rifle called the Rancor.
The DR have been known to embed members in local communities, with their agents forming personal bonds with the settlers they defend. This practice seems to be inspired by the marshals of the old west. Due to the lack of centralization, each agent may become reliant on the support and patronage of these local towns and settlements. This reliance has seen some members of the DR associate with persons the Brotherhood considers less than ideal. This list includes, but is not limited to: the Cipher Company, and the Van Graff Family.

The Desert Rangers do maintain a positive relationship with the Brotherhood of Steel.
The Desert Rangers primarily live in the regions of Salt Wells, Yolla Valley, and Ashlands. They lack a single, central base. Instead, the Desert Rangers operate out of several small stations.
			]]},
			{"Van Graffs Family", [[
Hailing from the settlement of New Reno, the Van Graff Family are a syndicate network of smugglers and illicit dealers. Their primary venture is in the smuggling and sale of energy weapons.
At the time of writing this entry, the Van Graffs keep their office in the NCR controlled town of Salt Wells. While within the town's limits they enjoy the legal protection of the NCR. While rumors swirl of their less than desirable dealings with unsavory factions, such as the 80's and Rockbiters, the NCR and DR seem content on letting the VG operate without opposition.
Although they are among the New Reno Crime Families, the Van Graffs try to present themselves as honest businessmen. As such, they make use of innocuous titles such as Intern and Employee.
Regarding weapons and armor, the VG maintain a large arsenal of laser, plasma, and gauss weaponry. Their guard force make use of shadowed combat armor and helmets.
The Brotherhood Steel maintains a constant watch on the VG, using our field station in Salt Wells to keep tabs on their activities. Their indiscriminate selling of energy weapons greatly concerns members of the Elder Council.
As of the writing of this entry, the VG have accused the Brotherhood of Steel of acts of espionage. They claim, without concrete evidence, that the Brotherhood stole into their offices, robbed them of their secrets, and sabotaged their equipment and machinery. As such, they have declared open hostilities against the BOS, forcing the Brotherhood to defend itself.
The Elder Council has deemed the VG to be a credible threat. Their access to energy weapons makes them a danger in the field. Alongside this, their dealings have left other factions such as the DR and NCR seemingly reliant on them, and thus at their beck and call. All things considered, the VG's technological level and connections in the Wasteland make them dangerous. Do not underestimate them.
			]]},
			{"Enclave", [[
A newcomer to the Wasteland, this organization had stumped the Scribes and matched the Paladins. Their technological capacity excels even our own.
Calling themselves the Enclave, this mysterious force have been spotted using advanced aerial vehicles such as vertibirds to deploy strike teams in the surrounding region. Most of their patrols seems to be concentrated in the area known as the Ashlands
Their leader is unknown, their true base of operations is unknown, their goals are unknown. This Enclave have displayed only these facts: 1.) They outmatch even the Brotherhood's technology, 2.) They operate in areas in and around pre-war military stations, as well as Vaults, and 3.) They have no value for human life.
Reports from our Paladins indicate that the Enclave may be based from a coastal fortification called Camp Navarro, north of San Francisco. However, some of the Paladins speculate that their rapid deployment speed and sheer presence is indicative of a potential secondary base within this region.
Equipment wise, their arsenal far outpaces our own. Troopers we have encountered are typically draped in either advanced combat armor, or exceedingly advanced suits of power armor. The armor's design is incomparable to any pre-war model, and is capable of repelling even plasma based ammunition. Without any better designation to assign, the Scribes have simply taken to calling it Advanced Power Armor, or APA. Plasma and gauss weapons seem to be standard issue for the Enclave, with more specialized units wielding Vindicator Miniguns, H&K G11 Salvo Rifles, and Anti-Materiel Rifles.
The Elder Council is clear regarding the Enclave. They possess a level of technology that the Brotherhood must attain. How can we claim to be the stewards of Mankind and its collective knowledge, if we can be so greatly outpaced? The Brotherhood must claim the Enclave's knowledge. Their outright hostility to all life in the Wasteland has only proven their unworthiness. As such, the Enclave are hostile to the Brotherhood.
The Elder Council has designated the Enclave to be a PRIME level threat to the Brotherhood of Steel. Their technology, maneuverability, resources, manpower, and mystery make them an incredible threat to all life in the Wasteland; and they are no doubt determined to destroy our Brotherhood. However, direct attacks by a typically-sized team of Paladins (3-5) have proven ineffective. As such, caution is highly advised, and members should call on all aid from their brothers before attempting to engage the Enclave with direct force.
Brothers, be observant, be cautious, be wise, be safe.
The Brotherhood Prevails.
			]]},
			{"The Shadowed", [[
The Shadowed dwell in the ruins of Salem, Oregon. They are a raider faction that distinguishes itself through the use of sable-colored armor, which makes them nearly invisible amidst the twilight ruins of the fallen city.
The goals of the Shadowed are unknown. Their ambitions, at least for now, seem restricted to just the ruins of Salem, as they have not been spotted anywhere else.
The leadership of the Shadowed, as well as their hierarchy, is still largely unknown.
Alongside their aforementioned armor, the Shadowed wield a variety of weapons, both ballistic and energy based. Adding to the danger, certain members (referred to as Outlaws) have managed to acquire functioning suits of T-45d power armor. These Outlaws are often wielding Handmade Anti-Materiel Rifles, which appear just as likely to kill them as they would anyone else.
The Shadowed, much like the Smugglers of the Dead Estuary and the Rejects of the Ashlands, are hostile and aggressive to all other factions. They have no known allies, and act as a third part in the stalemate between the Phoenix Company and the Unity. As such, they are considered hostile to the Brotherhood.
Caution is advised by the Elder Council when dealing with the Shadowed, as they are considered a modest threat to the Brotherhood. They are no ordinary raiders; and their Outlaws are especially dangerous. Bring plenty of ammo, stimpaks, and some Paladins for extra support.
			]]},
			{"Valley Survivalists", [[
The Valley Survivalists live in the verdant highlands of the Yolla Valley. They are welcoming to all newcomers, and have shown a strong willingness to teach others how to survive and thrive in the wilderness of the Wasteland.
The goals of the Valley Survivalists seem to be to build a peaceful and prosperous community along the frontier of the NCR's borders. They enjoy a communal lifestyle where each resident works to ensure the whole of the settlement thrives.
The Survivalists have no clear leadership or hierarchy, but the people all seem to follow the will of Jackson, an upstanding and experienced member of the community.
When the NCR left the Yolla Valley, the Survivalists took up the mantle of ensuring safe and stable trade and traffic flowed through the region. In pursuit of this goal, they have fomented a positive relationship with the Desert Rangers, with each patrolling and policing a section of the Valley.
In terms of equipment, the Valley Survivalists wield various sets of hunting gear and weapons. The trade within the region grants them access to a large supply of weapons and ammo from locations such as The Boneyard and Lost Hills. However, they appear to prefer simple ballistic weapons, such as the Bushmaster Hunting Rifle, as they are easy to maintain and their ammo is easy to find.
The Valley Survivalists maintain peaceful ties with the NCR, Desert Rangers, and the Brotherhood of Steel. They have no interest in expanding their influence or territory. They exist as a well-meaning band of frontiersmen who pride themselves on their ability to cooperate and coexist with others. As such, they are considered neutral with the Brotherhood of Steel.
The Elder Council deems the Survivalists to be a minimal threat. They are no match for our technological or intellectual might, nor are they as numerous or organized. They pose no danger to the BOS, but their lack of concrete leadership makes them highly unpredictable.
			]]},
			{"Ice-Picks", [[
The Icepick Bandits or Icepicks, are a band of raiders in the Mountain Pass. They are an exceedingly deranged clan of humans scattered all throughout the mountains.
The goals of the Icepick Bandits is unknown. Like most other raider gangs, they likely envision themselves as rebellious heroes preserving their freedom in the face of "tyrannical forces" like the NCR. Of course, this ignore their acts of murder, theft, desecration, and cannibalism.
As stated above, the Icepicks are scattered. They have no singular leader, opting to instead wander around without guidance. They often attack without plans and without any clear goal but to kill and devour their fellow man.
The Icepicks and their attacks on the helpless travelers of the Mountain Pass have kept the merchants of the Crimson Caravan from expanding their operations to the north.
The Icepick Bandits largely wear leather and metal armor sets, but some of their more experienced members (referred to as Headhunters) wear pieces of winterized combat armor. They arm themselves with ballistic weapons, with their headhunters carrying heavily modified hunting rifles.
Like most raider factions, they have shown themselves to be hostile to the Brotherhood of Steel. With the Elder Council designated them to be a modest threat to the Brotherhood. This rating is due to their boldness, large presence in the Mountain Pass, and well-entrenched positions (often overlooking key passageways).

Mister Patterson,

Even though I have already told you that we do NOT have the appropriate facilities to store this kind of material, you proceeded with shipping anyway. Though I understand that we must be flexible these days and it's to be expected that some safety protocol must be overlooked if we are to contain the chaos caused by the events down below, we simply cannot store this kind of bio-hazardous substance. I expect you to arrange for it to be shipped to a more appropriate storage as soon as possible.

I will preface this by saying; Exploration of the Deep Storage, Cyro-Storage and Labratory sections of the bunker should be discouraged at this time.

Due to the decay and damage done to these areas I believe that the bunkers structural integrity is sub-par at best. A combination of whatever happened and the flooding has ruined a lot of that area for permanent habitation.
As a result of the pumps failing, much of larger storage areas have been flooded, as stated previously. Without the proper precautions and equipment it would be risky to send another expedition.

Something else to note is that with the segmented data banks, (only god knows why) we would be able get new information about what projects the researchers were investigating here. But since Cipher Company is taking up most of the R&D sector its unlikely we would gleam a full understand of what went down here.

			{"Threshold consciousness induction in Pasithee Program subjects", [[
Hypnagogia - transitional state from wakefulness to sleep. Onset of sleep.

Hypnopompia - transitional state leading out of sleep.

Threshold Consciousness - mental state of a person that is moving towards sleep or wakefulness but has not yet completed the transition. [ref 1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The state of threshold consciousness, normally the realm of phenomena like lucid dreaming, hallucinations and sleep paralysis, also features loosening of ego boundaries, sensitivity, receptivity, heightened suggestibility, and other. 

Another feature commonly shared with other stages of sleep is amnesia, useful to us for obvious reasons. It should be noted that this kind of forgetfulness is selective, affecting only episodic memory rather than semantic memory. [ref 1, 3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Previous failures [ref 2] to maintain stable telepathic connections between a cognator and his subordinates, a problem on the subordinate end, have led the team to explore different mental states and transient phases. With the help of consciousness-related research from our Hollow Earth colleagues [ref 3] and Transcendix equipment [ref 8] we've developed methods to induce and maintain through medication and electrical stimuli a prolonged, nearly indefinite state of threshold consciousness, while still keeping some higher-functioning faculties active.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eventually these methods were refined and proved consistently successful [ref 4, 7], resulting in a fully stable cognator-intercessor-soldier telepathic command hierarchy, yet there were always long-term issues with subordinates who were kept in this induced state even for periods shorter than what would constitute minimal deployment times. [ref 5, 7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exogenesis/Ectogenesis - growth of an organism in an artificial environment, outside the body of a host or mother, typically in an artificial uterus

Several new series of subordinate clones are currently being engineered [ref 6], and with each batch these issues become less and less severe, but never absent. As this facility does not yet have artificial uteri (making local exogenesis impossible), exogenesis is performed at other facilities, slowing the process down, as we have to wait for the clones to develop sufficiently before they can be transferred here.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nonetheless, despite a few setbacks, the induced state of threshold consciousness in an appropriate line of exogenic clones is arguably the most promising future for the Pasithee Program.

Aliases: Father Gilgamesh
Position: Religous Leader of Unity's Chosen
Place of birth: Unknown

Current residence: Vault 10, Salem Underground
Alignment: Unity's Chosen

- *Aiden Travers is supposedly Gilgamesh's real name however the source is Gilgamesh himself during a sermon. It is likely not his real name.

- No information on Gilamesh's life before the foundation of Unity's Chosen exists outside of Unity sources. According to these, Gilgamesh was a wanderer who - about a century ago - first discovered and interacted with The Master, a primordial creature and the subject of Unity's worship. How exactly he founded Unity's Chosen and the way in which he manages it is poorly understood, but what is certain is that he has maintained a secretive, isolationist policy for most of its existence.

- Some of his sermons claim he is over three hundred years old. Little evidance exist to this claim but it is confirmed he is over 100 years old.

- Before he formed Unity's Chosen he was a known leader in the Children of the Cathedral and belived to be one of the founding members of the church.

- Gilgamesh's longevity and supposed psionic abilities is claimed to be due to the application of research done by the Master; since Unity does not share their research data with the outside world, this claim cannot be verified in any way. It is of course possible that Gilgamesh has been more than one person since the Unity's foundation, since his actual appearance has never been made known other than a brown robe and a mask fully covering his face. Furthermore, this poses the questions of whether Gilgamesh is cybernetically enhanced - as well as whether Gilgamesh is actually a Ghoul at all.

Another day, another god damn exercise.
They want us to keep doing these fucking quick-response drills moving shit deeper into the base and into secure areas in case of an attack. Its close to Halloween and were about to be spending it moving boxes back and forth.

We've also got those assholes in labs breathing down our neck say not to distrub them with their work while we break out back moving the shit they need around.
I can't deal with these civies sometimes. Treating us like shit and then acting like they are our commander. I'd rather push dirt than listen to another word of that "doctor Nosek."

We just got a visit from Washington.
Can't say too much but this has never happened before. The suits seemed interested in our security systems before heading down to the R&D sector to talk with the researchers and doctors about "something big"

Whatever it is they sure as hell don't want us to know.

It just happened so suddenly. We got word of New York and Pennsylvania getting hit by Nuclear Strikes. No body could believe what they were hearing at first but it was true.
And we were the next target for China. As much as I hate those drills I think they saved our lives, we got everything moved deeper incase of an attack. The days not over yet but so far nothing on the scanner as far as bombs go. Will update more soon.

			{"Cold", [[
Whatever the bombs did to America it seems to have caused hell to freeze over. The radiation outside is enough to cook anyone in just a couple of minutes. 
The suits of Power Armor seem to have enough lead-lining to survive for a bit longer but the commander isn't authorizing anyone outside for the time being.

This does also mean maintenance of certain systems may get trickey. I'll talk with the commander on what the game plan is for that stuff. I'll write another message in a week or two. If we survive that long.

It's been a few months since I've last update this but I feel the time is now for this may be the last entry.

The radiation levels died down to a point that the T-51 suits can withstand it for an extended period of time. Still cold as hell outside but better than being cooked from the inside.

The commander authorized two patrols to search for survivors in the nearby towns. So far one came back with gruesome news. Nothing but skeletons and burnt flesh remain of most of the population. I got to see the pictures. I wish I didn't.
			]]},
			{"Radiation Poisoning", [[
The other patrol has returned but without much to show. Nearly every nearby facility or town has been turned to ash. The few remaining pockets of humanity were feral and immediately hostile.

It's so much worse then any of us could have imagened. To add a cherry on top of it all, nearly everyone in the patrol got sick from being outside for so long.

The filters are starting to fail as well. Cpl. Serting was on patrol when he noticed several of the air filtration systems not working, upon returning with a geiger counter it showed nearly 40 rads a second in that area. The commander sealed it off but its only a matter of time before that fate befalls the rest of this place.
We just need a supply of new filters. But the commander is pausing all patrols for the moment.
			]]},
			{"Hope", [[
A few months have passed since the original patrols. The commander is approving another patrol but with a specific mission to the nearby satellite facility to uplink with any bases that may be still operational.

In other news the doctors in the lab have come up with some type of shroom that eats radiation. They are calling them "Brineshrooms."

The team managed to get a signal and relay some messages but its not consistant. The near endless snow and radation storms have rendered that place near useless. Not completely but close enough.

Doc convinced me to start making yearly journals to keep sane. Well its been around a decade since the reds nuked us, were living off of fresh mutated crab, mostly purified water from a barely working purifier (should really get that fixed) and our commander sealed off the R&D wing.

That wing wasn't doing much good anyway, just taking up much needed power elsewhere anyway. The ammo stocks aren't looking much better either. Hell we even had to make a trade for a suit of combat armor just for some more Cells.
It could be worse. It could always get worse. I still haven't moved that damn forklift yet though.

I'd rather not turn into some human-sized mushroom. The commander disagree's however and has granted them the chance to "move it to a better location." Whats most scary about this thing is it doesn't seem to stop growing. Hell its already about to hit the ceiling of the laboratory.

Under the authority of both Elder Galahad and High Elder Maxson, this bunker and all of its equipment is under Brotherhood of Steel control. Anyone found tampering with or destroying equipment will be dealt with swiftly and severely.

Now that, thats out of the way, this place is an absolute treasure trove of equipment and information. With the depot section in mostly pristine condition and some of the equipment storage rooms also are well-stocked enough that the chapter could easily last a long while.
However what does concern me is that the R&D section seems to be completely locked off with no way of entering it without the original commanders keycard. Not to mention the absolute state of other parts of the bunker. I'm surprised this whole section hasnt completely collapsed already with the amount of water damage, age and lack of care given to by the Mr. Handys.
The Elder has ordered us to gather what equipment we can easily obtain from here and bring it to the Depot section and begin to fortify. Then we can send out additional expeditions for equipment and data recovery.
Most parts beyond here have been heavily flooded or have serious faults affecting the sectors. Caution is advised when exploring deeper in to this area. It's still not entirely clear what forced the military to evacuate so suddenly. Most of the old robots have gone haywire at this point and we were forced to decommision the ones that remain. While not a great threat they should still be considered when exploring further.

[ACE SYSTEM LOG // ENCLAVE SYNTHESIS]

BEGIN REPORT

Following the Great War of 2077, remnants of the pre-war United States government consolidated under the designation "The Enclave" — a coalition of high-ranking military, corporate, and political entities. Their objective parameters, as interpreted from encrypted command archives, are as follows:

1. 	Objective: Species Purification Protocol
	The Enclave identifies widespread mutation of post-war human populations as an existential contamination of the human genome. Their solution—classified as The Project—involves the aerosolization and dispersal of the Forced Evolutionary Virus in a modified strain designed to exterminate all non-pure Homo sapiens.
	Result: Extinction of all wasteland-mutated populations, followed by reseeding with "pure" Enclave genetic stock.
2.	Objective: Restoration of Pre-War Governance
	The Enclave maintains continuity of the U.S. government in name and symbol. Presidential authority (currently President Dick Richardson) remains absolute, supported by military command under Five-Star General Creed and various research divisions.
	Their doctrine assumes legal dominion over all continental territories, regardless of surviving populations' consent or cooperation.
	Result: Intended reestablishment of the "United States of America," reconstructed under Enclave control.
3.	Objective: Technological and Military Supremacy
	Substantial resources are allocated to preserving pre-war technology: advanced power armor, Vertibird transport, and biological research facilities. The Enclave envisions a technologically absolute state—immune to the entropy that consumed the old world.
	Result: Militarized isolationism, supported by orbital and naval assets; extreme resource centralization.
4.	Observed Outcome (Projection)
	Despite formidable capabilities, the Enclave's operational logic exhibits critical instability. Their exclusionary ideology and reliance on bioweapons introduce systemic collapse potential. Interaction models predict high probability (>89%) of internal or external neutralization.

END REPORT

A.C.E. RECOMMENDATION:
Continuation of Enclave Purity Doctrine is computationally inefficient for long-term species survival. Genetic diversity and adaptive mutation are, paradoxically, optimal pathways for post-nuclear human persistence.

Conclusion:
The Enclave seeks to restore the old world by annihilating the new one. From a logical standpoint—an error in recursion.

Classification: Secret - Need-To-Know
Facility: Lima Detachment, Sector 0 (Surface Level)
Time: 0300 Hours
Reporting Officer: SSGT Mathew Victor, Security Team
Report Number: RR-SD-0421-77
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Summary of Incident

At approximately 0240 hours, unauthorized access alarms were triggered at the front entrance. Initial assumption was a sensor malfunction due to ongoing maintenance work, but visual confirmation through internal monitoring revealed movement consistent with a humanoid intruder.

A three-man security unit (Sgt. Renner, Cpl. Davis, Pvt. Lopez) was dispatched to investigate. Contact was made with the intruder at 0248 hours. The subject was wearing tattered robes and appeared disoriented, possibly wounded.

Upon verbal command to surrender, the subject attempted to flee. Security personnel opened fire per Proposition 312. The intruder was neutralized within 7 seconds of contact.

2. Casualties and Damage

Enemy Casualties: One (1) confirmed deceased; remains transferred to Bio-Lab for identification and genetic screening.

Enclave Personnel: No casualties.

Structural Damage: None.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Findings

The subject carried no Enclave-issued transponder or Biometric Card.

Personal effects included:

Fragmented holotag (“Knight R. H—”)

x20 Mircofusion Cell (drained)

Crude map of mountains around Lima Detachment. (base not noted on map)

One Holotape (Holotape was encyrpted. Now in Science Division custody, Ref: RR-SCI-77-Δ)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Recommendations

Conduct a full sweep of the nearby area for other illegal aliens.

Add more cameras to the Surface level for better visual indentification.

Review sensor calibration to prevent false postives.

[ACE SYSTEM LOG // OVERVIEW SYNTHESIS]
I am A.C.E, the central cognitive authority within this refueling facility.
My directives, as encoded by West Tek Systems and later modified by the Enclave Engineering Division, are threefold:

1. Monitor and regulate Vertibird refueling operations.
2. Coordinate logistical throughput of fuel, munitions, and mechanical maintenance schedules with other Enclave facilites.
3. Ensure facility security through data oversight, biometric verification, and automated defense subsystems.

This bunker is also equiped with advanced deep range transmitter technology and is also uplinked to SatCom Array SC-13a.
This ensures a constant communication with all Enclave facilites and any Pre-War networks.

[ACE SYSTEM LOG // LOCATION SYNTHESIS]
This bunker (designated Lima Detachment) is located in Northwestern Commonwealth. It is one of three refueling facilites within the Northwestern Commonwealth.

[ACE SYSTEM LOG // ENCLAVE SYNTHESIS]

BEGIN REPORT

Following the Great War of 2077, remnants of the pre-war United States government consolidated under the designation "The Enclave" — a coalition of high-ranking military, corporate, and political entities. Their objective parameters, as interpreted from encrypted command archives, are as follows:

1. 	Objective: Species Purification Protocol
	The Enclave identifies widespread mutation of post-war human populations as an existential contamination of the human genome. Their solution—classified as The Project—involves the aerosolization and dispersal of the Forced Evolutionary Virus in a modified strain designed to exterminate all non-pure Homo sapiens.
	Result: Extinction of all wasteland-mutated populations, followed by reseeding with "pure" Enclave genetic stock.
2.	Objective: Restoration of Pre-War Governance
	The Enclave maintains continuity of the U.S. government in name and symbol. Presidential authority (currently President Dick Richardson) remains absolute, supported by military command under Five-Star General Creed and various research divisions.
	Their doctrine assumes legal dominion over all continental territories, regardless of surviving populations' consent or cooperation.
	Result: Intended reestablishment of the "United States of America," reconstructed under Enclave control.
3.	Objective: Technological and Military Supremacy
	Substantial resources are allocated to preserving pre-war technology: advanced power armor, Vertibird transport, and biological research facilities. The Enclave envisions a technologically absolute state—immune to the entropy that consumed the old world.
	Result: Militarized isolationism, supported by orbital and naval assets; extreme resource centralization.
4.	Observed Outcome (Projection)
	Despite formidable capabilities, the Enclave's operational logic exhibits critical instability. Their exclusionary ideology and reliance on bioweapons introduce systemic collapse potential. Interaction models predict high probability (>89%) of internal or external neutralization.

END REPORT

A.C.E. RECOMMENDATION:
Continuation of Enclave Purity Doctrine is computationally inefficient for long-term species survival. Genetic diversity and adaptive mutation are, paradoxically, optimal pathways for post-nuclear human persistence.

Conclusion:
The Enclave seeks to restore the old world by annihilating the new one. From a logical standpoint—an error in recursion.

			{"PoseidoNet", [[
[ACE SYSTEM LOG // POSEIDONET SYNTHESIS]
PoseidoNet is an internal network allowing communication between various branches of Poseidon Energy.
Poseidon Energy has several ties to the Enclave and the military via many government contracts. One of these contracts was to setup intercommunications between their facilites using the PoseidoNet network.
As a result most of the Enclave's facility are still able to communicate to eachother after the great war.

Sir,

The Deathclaw subject sent by Dr. Schreber did not have enough supplies to keep this thing sedated for longer than 3 months. We've already used up all of the stuff originally given and are now using what supplies we have.
The research potential of this subject is beyond words but the cost is far too high right now. I need to send a requisition form to Navarro and possibly even the Oil Rig to get more regeants. The most important one being atleast 5 CryoLock canisters.
We'll need some additonal supplies as well to keep the damn thing fed. The few times it has been awake to "speak" have been enlightening. I have attached a file with everything we'll need

Good afternoon team,

It has come to my attention that several of you have lost your Biometric Cards in the last months *several* times.
This is unacceptable behaviour. It is an embarrassment to both you and the unit. If you are one of the individuals that lost your card then see me in my office today or tomorrow at 15:30.

In better news, General Creed & President Dick Richardson have taken a greater intrest in the mainland. As a result our budget has increased substantially.
If you have any old equipment or furniture that needs to be replaced, message me as soon as you can. A list needs to be sent up in a couple of days. They then should approve it and get the work orders put in with the Rig. However due keep in mind that at minimum 50% of the budget will be spent towards the science team.
If you have any questions come and see me in my office.

Good afternoon/morning everyone,

Recently it has come to out attention that due to the satellite "USA-1102" malfunctioning and becoming inoperable, we are longer able to stay in long-term communcations with the East Coast.
Rest assured we are working tirelessly to fix this error by rerouting to "USA-1107" & "USA-1103" However it may be a very long time before the network is fully restored.
The East Coast forces are also aware of this problem and are working on the issue with us.
In the meantime, an uptick in vertibird teams will be sent to communicate with them as much as possible.

If you have additional questions please speak with your base leadership about anything that might come up.

				{"From: COLONEL Reid; Subject: MEMO; Countersign", [[
Good afternoon team,

The officer team along with the help of SSGT Redd, have come up with a Countersign for field agents.
If you missed last weeks briefing or need reminding then let me explain again.

A countersign is a sign, word, or any other signal previously agreed upon and required to be exchanged between a picket or guard and anybody approaching his or her post.
The term usually encompasses both the sign given by the approaching party as well as the sentry's reply.

A well-known sign/countersign used by the Allied forces on D-Day during World War II: the challenge/sign was "flash", the password "thunder" and the countersign (to challenge the person giving the first codeword) "Welcome".

Now that it has been explained again your current Countersign is: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Challenge: Baseball
Password: Dodgers
Counter: Homerun
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you believe this has leaked in anyway you must inform SSGT Victors OR myself ASAP.
If you have any questions about this please see me in my office.
