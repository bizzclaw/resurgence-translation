Shadow wave frequencies:

Infra (<0.5Hz) - No perceptible stimulation and no short-term effects.
Delta (0.5-3Hz) - Faint, distant aural beat in the range of 5-15bpm. No visual stimulation.
Theta (3-8Hz) - Deep stimulation of unconscious cognition: inductive reasoning, memory recollection, creativity, association, language, etc.
Alpha (8-12Hz) - Sense of great relaxation and loss of sense of time and spatial awareness.
Beta (12-38Hz) - Lucid audiovisual hallucinations.
Gamma (38-42Hz) - Increased analytic cognitive performance: deductive reasoning, complex problem-solving, etc.
Upsilon (42-60Hz) - Increased psionic performance across most disciplines. Exhausting for non-psionic subjects, severe headaches in extreme cases.

Frequencies higher than 60Hz are considered dangerous and should only be used with psionic subjects while exercising extreme caution.

Shadow wave frequencies:

Infra (<0.5Hz) - Sense of vermicular motion inside head and abdomen. Mild headache and intestinal pain in approximately half of subjects.
Delta (0.5-3Hz) - Violent pounding in ears, sometimes accompanied by hissing, growling and screaming. No visual stimulation.
Theta (3-8Hz) - Creeping terror, distress, coldness.
Alpha (8-12Hz) - Sense of asphyxiation and claustrophobia.
Beta (12-38Hz) - Temporary loss of sight and hearing with the exception of sporadic audiovisual visions most commonly containing flashing pairs of lights, serpentine motion and indiscernible echoing sounds.
Gamma (38-42Hz) - Suicidal urges, madness, often leading to cerebral hemorrhaging and death. Complete and overwhelming sensory hallucinations.

Frequencies higher than 42Hz will consistently result in death of subjects that have inhaled shadow dust.

Dr. Maetall's drawings:
The first drawing features a black background with a few white squiggly lines, some thicker, some thinner. Nothing more.
The second sketch is more elaborate: There are about twenty or so lines horizontally parallel to one another, with some having warm coloration - red, orange, yellow, etc. - either all the way through or partially until turning white again. They are shaped like sine waves with smooth, constant amplitude, but some waves are only uniform up until they spiral out of order and outside the bounds of the drawing.
The third sketch is yet more elaborate: The background is still black, but all of the lines are colored without restrictions. Their mutual spatial relationship feels organized in a fully two-dimensional way, while their shapes are more varied in size and proportions, if still rounded for the most part. Simple geometrical shapes like triangles and squares split in half diagonally are also present, as if emerging from some kind of fabric formed by the underlying intertwistment of multicolored lines.

Yet the form is purely abstract and doesn't reference anything from the real world.::
The fourth drawing is completely blank.
The fifth drawing can easily be mistaken for a long-lost work of abstract art: It's a fully-colored, three-dimensional painting of warped land or water - or something completely different - with angular shapes of complex geometry placed on it with a great sense of spatial awareness and proportion. The colors are overwhelming, as if the painter was compensating for their lack of vividness or some other inherent property, and many lines were drawn multiple times with slight deviations in their dimensionality. You are able to see through the distracting colors and deceptive lines to discover otherworldly forms. The background - whatever it is - as mangled and undefined as it may look, feels strangely alive - for a still image! - and in some kind of sensory motion, as if the visuals want to expand into sounds and scents but never *actually* do. The complex shapes - peculiar polyhedral architecture and machines are more defined and in some ways appear to conquer this realm; they do not appear to be fit for human beings - at least not of our size and proportions - but perhaps something entirely different.
The sixth drawing represents a cold, calculated organization of shapes, void of artistry and human emotion - a technical drawing, in essence. The rounded shapes are predominant again as well as a few merged tetrahedrons, and colors are uniform in distribution and saturation. This is the first one that features text - formulae that seem to describe properties of the drawn reality and relate them to our own.
The seventh drawing is unfinished, being only about one third done. It is a chaotic amalgamation of all the previous works, containing spirals and triangles and half-written formulae. Its incompleteness doesn't have a sense of drawing direction you're familiar with; instead, there are many holes in the composition - certain spots just lack color, whereas some other spots are completely blank, and there is no discernible pattern to any of this.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early collection:
This folder contains numerous drawings by various individuals, ranging from simple black and white sketches to colorful portrayals of mind-bending objects, worlds or purely abstract concepts. Rounded, wave-like or spiraling lines pervade the imagery, and triangles, pyramids or tetrahedrons - depending on dimensions featured - are also common motifs.
There are a few notable ones:

A transparent submarine dripping with black, slimy mass. Beams of light illuminate it from the dark below.
A human figure cutting the monolith depicted as being laid down horizontally on the floor. There is black smoke rising from it and filling the room before falling back down as specs of dust.
Some strange flying machine with large wings speeding through fog. Its dimensions and other properties are written next to it.
A man and a woman with their hands reaching up. Tentacles emerge from below and hold them by their legs.
Anatomy of a woman with some unknown markings on her vital organs. Her skin is colored green.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Contemporary collection:
This folder contains numerous drawings by various individuals, most of them disturbing in form and content. They feature twisted perspectives, strong colors that bleed into one another, serpents and other sinister-looking creatures devouring or simply slaughtering humanoid beings, as well as creatures of other kinds. 

Some of these drawings contain formulas, occult rather than scientific, regarding things done to flesh that is often featured next to these inscriptions, drawn in one way or the other.
Some are more notable than others: 

Humanoid reptilians driving spears into a hairy, muscular four-legged creature. They are in the middle of an endless pool of blood.
A serpent constricting various objects: people, machines, cities, celestial bodies and things greater. Often titled as "Sørmir" or "Flottsørm" - or most commonly "Flottsørmir."
A vortex of some kind, dark-centered and surrounded by people both alive and dead. All of the living ones are bowing deeply but the one who's sprinkling some kind of black dust all over it. The dead are never whole.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The dark screen slowly turns purple. Colorful and detailed spiraling shapes of mathematical perfection begin to appear in the middle of the screen, becoming more and more concentrated in the very center until a symmetrical image finally gains form. The shapes repeat in different configurations and are self-similar - composed of smaller identical or almost identical shapes to itself, diminishing in scale to apparent infinity.

The text underneath the image indicates that the image is being rendered in real time from some kind of mathematical function, and you are given the option to zoom further in.
You zoom into the center. The macroshape outgrows the screen and reveals its fractal composition whose constituents then again grow larger and radiate away as you zoom in. Colors change and shapes reconfigure, and the longer you stare into the infinite center the more it feels like you're descending into new realities, losing sight of the previously obvious patterns and building blocks.
From purple vastness you fall into a spiraling azure sea whose surface forms the maw of the universe that swallows you and squeezes you past the bright stars and into a quasar containing a lair of slithering green serpents between which clouds of glistening dust conceal scorching pits of molten rock forming an iced island on which lush orange vegetation homes the swarms of yellow thousand-legged insects crawling around their monstrous black queen whose single compound eye reflects floating polyhedrons between which cosmic arcs of lightning wreak havoc that disintegrate reality and funnel it broken into a spiraling singularity...
...which is in fact a great serpent. You can no longer zoom in.

			{"The Cube", [[
Research Log 1:

We are examining what appears to be some sort of electronic device. It's an irregular polyhedron resembling a number of concentric intersected cubes of various sizes. It appears to be made from a very light semi-metallic material. Its color is bluish dark gray.

The artifact might feature movable parts, but none of them responded to gentle pressure so no further attempts to reconfigure the device were made in fear of damaging it.

The artifact features one to six unrecognized symbols on each of its many sides. Some sides also feature sockets, none of which comply with Vault-Tec or previous standards.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Research Log 2:

The artifact does not appear to be emitting radiation or electromagnetic waves. However, due to us having a reason to believe that this object is still somehow traceable at long distances, we have taken the precaution of keeping it at a second or higher level of isolation at all times.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Research Log 3:

Most of the sockets appear to be non-functional or dormant. However, a number of sockets, if engaged in a way that disables their safety breaks, act as extremely high-voltage, high direct current power sources. This laboratory does not currently possess the equipment to harvest this power or even safely experiment on it further.

Since we cannot, at this point, trace the origin or explain the manufacturing process of this extremely powerful device, it can be safely categorized as a xeno-artifact.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Research Log 5:

Referencing previous research documents on various xeno-artifacts revealed the meaning of two symbols: one of which denotes direct electric current (this symbol appears, among other places, near the active sockets). 

The other one appears in a single spot near an inactive socket and is a bit less straight-forward since various researchers and xenoarcheologists cannot agree upon its meaning, but according to them it signifies gravitational field, space-time curvature, singularity, or one of the related phenomena such as event horizon, or a combination of these.

You feel pressure mounting inside your skull...::
You blink to reveal a new addition to your reality: Before you stands a young woman, a doctor wearing a white lab coat. Her entire body, hair, face, clothes - name tag as well - everything is smeared with green viscous blood. It is oozing out of her wounds and toward the floor, never reaching it but merely fading to oblivion. Her expression - a plea for salvation, if not through action then through observation...
You let her have your eyes...
The world darkens, the woman is glowing - and dissolving. Her once-lovely plump face, now bathed in green radiance, is degenerating into a visage of ineffable torment. She is frantically trying to hold it in place with her formless, useless hands.
Her gleaming hair is stretching into streams of odious slime and abandoning her scalp, while her charmingly green eyes are becoming repulsively greener, more swollen and less human. She cries and cries, caustic tears rolling down her departing cheeks, but her cries are silent. Silent, thankfully, for even if void of sound her misery is great enough to clot your very own blood.
Slowly, the horrid scene fades away, much like her oozing blood did, but not to oblivion and certainly not before scarring your eyes.

The pressure in your head is gone.

Discovery

The "Black Monolith" was first uncovered at the Abyssal Excavation Site Six (exact year and date unknown; closest estimate: between LE-BD 20 and 30), several years after the construction of Abyssal Station Zero. The Monolith is a 3m tall deep-black structure in the shape of a hexagonal prism augmented with pyramidal frustums at its top and bottom. It is composed of a material so dense it required four heavy sublifters to bring it to the station; at 108 tonnes its density was calculated to be 30.016g/cm3. Transporting it from the Manufacturing Dome required reinforcing the floor with RG panels and using superlubric mats to eliminate friction when pushed by strongmen.

Composition test No. 142 (143) (Date unavailable):

The test was performed after an upgrade to the nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscope module in the hopes that it will finally allow us to determine the molecular structure of the Black Monolith after numerous failed attempts. To our dismay, but sadly consistent with all our previous tests, this one too gave us no results. The Black Monolith is impenetrable to all our instruments and impervious to all tools with which we've tried to obtain samples. In agreement with Dr. Määrsson we are ceasing all attempts at further testing the monolith's physical properties until means to obtain samples are provided. We will instead focus all of our research on the Shadow Waves.

			{"Shadow Waves", [[
Shadow Waves

A shadow wave is a transverse wave radiated by the Black Monolith which during its first half-period exhibits measurable physical interactions (*positive extancy*) but no measurable interactions during its second half-period (*negative extancy*). In normal conditions the change between positive and negative extancy occurs at frequencies of ~0.2Hz, meaning that the wave completes one full cycle in ~0.4Hz with an average wavelength of ~16 microns. The points where extancy states come to an end are called *shadow wave extancy limits*, or more specifically negative and positive extancy limits for each of the respective states of interaction.
The extent to which the shadow waves interact with material reality is not yet known, but so far we've measured the more obvious electromagnetic interactions ("Effects of Shadow Waves on Electromagnetic Fields, by Dr. E. Herman Simmer"), some weak nuclear interactions (Radioactive Decay at Shadow Wave Extancy Limits, Dr. Tarben Vörengær) and some strong nuclear interactions (Quark Chromodynamic Perturbations at Shadow Wave Extancy Limits, Dr. Størr Øivindr). Unaccounted-for increases and decreases in mass at extancy limits have also been measured, but due to its inconsistent manifestation and magnitude we've yet to draw solid conclusions with respect to gravitational effects of the wave.
Most of these perturbations and otherwise unexplained phenomena occur near or at extancy limits, whereas during positive extancy the shadow wave carries energy in the form of a regular electromagnetic wave (starting at the negative and ending at the positive extancy limit of that period) in a somewhat predictable fashion, depending on properties measured. How the energy is carried from positive to negative extancy limits (for all intents and purposes, how the wave comes into existence again) and why and how these limits (which can be represented as fields causing these interactions) manifest in space is yet unknown. What is clear is that changes in this electromagnetic component wave during positive extancy of the shadow wave is conserved throughout its negative extancy - meaning that it is without a doubt *the* same wave which alternates between affecting and not affecting physical reality - as all of our research suggests - in quite possibly all of its fundamental aspects.
The electromagnetic wave (which we've studied the most of all interactions) exhibits an unusual kind of elliptical polarization defined by Høldänsen's disjoint function. Informally it has been dubbed the "serpentine polarization," as its graph representation bears the likeness of a snake spiraling through space. All attempts at polarizing the wave in any way have proven unsuccessful, as the wave will be repolarized as soon as the shadow wave enters its negative extancy, meaning that, after passing negative extancy limit, the EM wave will again have serpentine polarization.

			{"Shadow Waves Manipulation", [[
Shadow Wave Manipulation, by Dr. Gustav Määrsson

So far we've determined that Shadow Wave can be partially manipulated through changes in the electromagnetic field during positive extancy. This means that by giving the wave more energy at appropriate extancy limits we can, for instance, change its frequency in a manner that is consistent with our understanding of the laws of reality. However, this also produces amplified and so far unpredictable quantum effects at extancy limits, both positive and negative, depending on how the wave had been manipulated and the medium through which it passes.
The shadow waves can be directed through space by guiding them into orion tubes with a massive magnetic field shaper at the base of the monolith. In these tubes we can shoot photons at specific intervals, aiming for either negative or positive extancy limits so that we may study the resulting quantum interactions ("The Consistency of Heinlein's Law in Electron-Positron Annihilation Near Negative Extancy Limits" by Dr. E. Herman Simmer). 
The process can be dangerous if too much energy is introduced, which has resulted in two accidents already, but controlled wave manipulation at positive extancy limits will create relatively stable changes in the wave. What quantum interactions occur at negative extancy limit, like the creation of new particles (actual and not virtual) is currently beyond the scope of our understanding.

Object Negation Experiment No. 5

This experiment was conducted to test the hypothesized *complete negation* of objects from reality with PSWB (Phased Shadow Wave Beam) technology. The object used for this experiment is a standard-sized pseudobrass cup suspended in an MO-5 testing sphere.
By channeling the shadow wave through two 5.3 meter long orion tubes and introducing increasing* amounts of energy at every positive extancy limit we are able to achieve the desired frequency of 67.5Hz for both waves. One wave is then continuously phase-shifted in the range of ~175-185 degrees while the PSWB is being focused on the cup. After the darkening effect*††* has been achieved, another energy surge is needed to completely negate the cup from existence, a process which occured in less than 0.15 seconds. The experiment, besides proving the Negation hypothesis also proves Bøtten's principle that strong chemical bonds will ensure that whole objects will be affected.

*(using Simmer's resonance function)*
*(Shadow Photons and the Darkening Effect, Dr. E. Herman Simmer)*
In conclusion, the fifth test was a complete success, the only losses being the two orion tube and one MO-5 sphere. However, those could hardly be called losses, not because of the relatively small cost of the equipment but moreso due to the fact that changes in their chemical structure and the formation of these unknown liquid crystal compounds will provide our team with new studying material.

Anamorphic Disk

Today we received something called an "anamorphic disk." It is supposedly capable of cutting the Black Monolith. It came in an external shipment, the details of which are oddly kept away from all of us (lowly engineers). At first glance it is a rather unimpressive rubbery disk 20cm in diameter and 1cm thick(!), gray in color, of a rough texture, made out of some unknown synthetic material we were explicitly instructed not to scan and to keep in cryo except during use. This thing is something no sane person would see as a cutting tool, let alone something that could damage an object as impervious as the Black Monolith. However, after doing some testing at the shop we now view the anamorphic disk in a completely different light.
The disk arrived with a Seddar SG-88M large diameter grinder on whose end it is to be attached, which frankly gives it a comically disproportionate appearance. Speaking of comical, are we really expected to believe that such a primitive tool as a mechanical grinder with a rubber gasket at its end will achieve what the most technologically advanced lasers and plasma cutters at our disposal can't? These thoughts went through all of our minds - and then we fired the thing up.
Within the span of a second the disk flattened while tripling in diameter, its gray color becoming much lighter in shade. In this state, the disk could cut anything we tested it on: pseudobrass, steel, all the way to stronger alloys and minerals, even a G5-rated diamond, and did so with little resistance.
Will it cut the monolith? That would be the ultimate test. We were instructed to modify a strongman to use the grinder and ensure that it is capable of performing the cut, taking all of the potential variables into account; no idea how they came up with those, but what do I know - I'm just an engineer. Hopefully the cut will be performed tomorrow, after which I will file another report.
